This is it, folks! It’s been a quick six months, hasn’t it? 

I want to thank everybody who participated in these rewatch threads; as quiet as this sub may be, it’s been so neat to finally have the kind of quality discussions on this show that I’ve been looking for. So thank you, and let’s do this again sometime."
1,Just started watching it and have a few questions. I'm a huge Sorkin fan and recently picked up this show to watch. So far I'm loving Jeff Daniels but I'm having some issues with the Maggie and a little bit with the Mac character. I dunno if it's a Sorkin thing but I can't really stand either of them when they're on the screen. They just seem so spazzy all the time. Is that going to change? I literally had to turn off the show during episode 3 (I think) because it was border like obnoxious.
2,"The Unofficial Rewatch Thread - S3E05: “Oh Shenandoah” **From IMDB:** Shocking information regarding the source comes to light in the fight for Will's freedom.

3,"On the bus, early season 2 Added the spoiler tag just in case....

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the first 2-3 episodes of season 2, Jim keeps asking question and getting canned responses or asking for time with the candidate and getting rejected.  Why doesn't he just file a story about how the candidate or his staff keep stonewalling him? Or how the candidate isn't willing to answer the difficult questions?  Is it just a plot device or would there be some type of blowback from those actions?"
4,"The Unofficial Rewatch Thread: S3E04 - “Contempt” **From TV.com:** Will refuses to reveal the source of stolen government documents even though he could go to jail for contempt. Meanwhile, Sloan and Mac search for a last-minute buyer for ACN when Charlie's had it with Lucas; and Hallie's new job puts a strain on her relationship with Jim.

**From HBO:** Will faces a contempt charge; Sloan and Mac try to prevent ACN from falling into Lucas's hands.

17,"Three episodes left in my first watch and I still dont get why Jim is into Maggie Sometimes I see the screen chemistry between them, but more often then not, I dont understand why they were ever troubled to be into each other for so long.

It seems to be a running theme on the show.

The only pairing that had a ton of chemsitry but was never explored was Neal and Sloan!

21,"Jeff Daniels in Rolling Stone: Stories From the Edge This may be off topic, but this is a pretty quiet sub so I don't think it's off-kilter to recommend something that's tangentially related to the show.

This is a two-part HBO documentary series about the history of Rolling Stone Magazine. Jeff Daniels is the voice of the articles when they are read in the series (with the exception of Hunter S. Thompson's articles which are read by Johnny Depp).

Anyway, as a Newsroom fan I kinda like it because it sort of feels like it's Will McAvoy reading it. I'm sure Daniels is channeling a bit of the character in it. I suggest y'all check it out. I'm sure you can find it on HBO Go. I'm Canadian so I watch it on CraveTV."

29,"[SPOILER] Everything wrong with the Operation: Genoa story arc. SPOILER: So the gist of the entire second season of the Newsroom was like this: The entire news team went on air with a damning story about an alleged war crime committed by the US government, but without actually confirming anything in the evidence. They based their entire investigation on assumption and secondhand information. And the  plot twists that exposed the lie and brought the story and characters down were contrived and thrown in out of nowhere. The soldier having a TBI, The mission manifest having secret ink on the paper because a vindictive guy (who we don't know) who had a drug addict son who killed himself (who we also don't know) and blames Charlie (which is stupid) . The obvious plot hole of Jim recommending Jerry take his place, but then says he doesn't know who Jerry is. And then Will's source happens to be the same vindictive guy, yet Will decides not to say anything? The thing about it all is. The Genoa story would've immediately been invalidated without MacKenzie resorting to checking the interview footage that showed the altered shot clock in the basketball game perpetrated by Jerry Dantana. The characters simply suspended simple reasoning when it came to looking over and qualifying the Genoa, and the writers overlooked what would actually happen if a news organization actually reported a story like Genoa.

&amp;#x200B;

But here are the main observations that I noticed that need to be conveyed on why the Genoa arc was so poorly written:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Charlie Skinner and the manifest. Yes the manifest had the invisible ink that enemy dude who wanted revenge on Charlie put on it (which is very contrived and poor writing). Let's be clear: Charlie didn't verify anything on that manifest and decided to run the Genoa report. He saw a vague code on the item list, and immediately just believed it was the sarin gas. And Charlie said he took the manifest to different quartermasters to verify its authenticity. How is it not one of those quartermasters caught the invisible ink ploy? Going on the premise that he believed it was an authentic mission manifest, he still didn't verify the mysterious item as the sarin gas. This was poor reporting. Charlie Skinner is who I shoulder most of the blame of the downfall of ACN over Genoa. I think the writers in season 2 didn't really pay attention to the kind of man Charlie Skinner is, because during season 2 Charlie seems to have suspended all his principles and reasoning that he laid on thick in the first season. In the first season Charlie was a very principled journalist in how news stories were to be reported. He was filtering about information presented to him, even if it was beyond doubt. During the episode where Sloan Sabath conducted the news in Japanese over the Fukashima crisis, he immediately shouted her down like a huge asshole in the middle of the newsroom in the most berating way possible. ""WE DON'T REPORT ON WHAT YOU THINK, SLOAN!!!""  And even calling for an elaborate investigation of all her past work because he thinks she's no longer credible as a reporter? Then he meets the old NSA guy about Reese secretly hacking phones. The news team confirms he's a legitimate NSA analyst, but Charlie brushes him off because his security clearance got downgraded, so Charlie feels the story will be contaminated using him. But in season 2, the OSI guy who had a stupid secret revenge plot against Charlie, hands him this manifest and gives some vague inferences about a mission, and Charlie just accepts it. Doesn't question him at all. Yet NSA guy getting downgraded for prostitution gets overlooked. Hell, even during Red Team III he says ""I BELIEVE IT'S THE SARIN"", not ""I CONFIRMED IT'S THE SARIN."" Charlie reported on what he believed, which makes him the most out of character of the season. 
2. The hamni8 tweet. One of the factors of the Genoa investigation was this fictional twitter. It turned out the the user's cell plan ran out, but the news team decided to believe he was killed during Genoa. Since Neal was behind investigating that, why didn't he figure that out? He found out the internet troll who was stalking Will in season 1 which is why he had a bodyguard. But more to the point, the news team had no information on the identity of who hamni8 even was, but yet was deemed credible for evidence for Genoa? No name or contact info. The problem I have with this is, in season 1, during the Egyptian revolution episode, Neal had a friend in Egypt willing to go out and film the events because Elliot was injured. MacKenzie on the other hand tells the informant that he needs to reveal his name and face, or otherwise the story won't have credibility. In which case I yelled at the TV ""But it does have credibility, he's f@#king there filming the Egyptian riots!"" The informant, Khalid, complies and reveals himself and gets captured by forces. Yet a twitter handle by an unknown person is perfectly suitable evidence. When Neal told the lawyers in the meeting ""I am not credible to judge the evidence"" I agree. And there was no evidence and certainly no judging being done by any of the characters involved.
3. The interview with the marine general. MacKenzie and Charlie meet a marine general they used as a key witness for Genoa. The marine general immediately figured out they were talking about sarin when discussing the Genoa mission. He agrees to do the interview, so obviously he's going to expect a question about if sarin was used in Genoa. So when Jerry Dantana directly asked him ""was sarin used in Genoa?"" the marine general decides to be stupid and answers ""if we used sarin...""  I yell at the TV even louder ""SIMPLY ANSWER NO!!!!"" Are the serious with this? A competent military executive would not open himself up with ""if we used"". He expected the question, he should've directly answered ""No"" and stuck with ""No"", not explain the logisitics of sarin, or ""if we used sarin."" He basically asked to be edited out of context. 
4. The pacing of the fallout of Genoa. After Genoa airs, the newsroom seems awfully quiet. The report got millions of viewers as Charlie reports to Will. The characters are seen sitting around waiting for a response from the government. But if this was reality now, upon watching the Genoa report, every other news organization in the world would be on the phone with ACN picking the Genoa story apart. Every news organization would've called their military and government sources to confirm Genoa, and then call ACN and ask what the hell did they just report? It would be a high stress and noisy newsroom with phones ringing every minute, not quiet and business as usual. They wouldn't even get to the meeting where everyone agrees to stick with the Genoa story. Genoa would've fallen much sooner. And Jerry Dantana revealing the TBI and that the solider lied about it, and that Maggie wasn't in the room. No serious journalist would've backed down from jerry's defensive tirade. I was waiting for Charlie to immediately call for an investigation of Jerry's reporting like he threatened with Sloan. Again characters not being logical. 

I'd like to hear if other fans have an opinion on this."

I immediately thought of Ben Shapiro, and Bernie Sanders.  Then I thought maybe it was just nothing.

I've never been clear whether Charlie was in Vietnam as a reporter or a soldier, but AFAIK Mai Lai was the most prominent of the war crimes committed by the U.S. in Vietnam, perhaps the only one that saw a conviction of any kind...is it safe to say that's what Charlie was referencing in his response to Jerry?"

56,"Two of my favorite scenes S03E03 -- 'Main Justice' -- has two of my favorite scenes in the entire show.

First, Mac meeting Jim and Don at the bar. So short but brilliantly executed, imo. The journey of these two characters (Jim and Don) goes from hostility (season 1) to mutual respect (season 2) and culminates in them basically becoming co-conspirators. They barely said anything in that scene, but you could tell that they straight up trusted each other with their lives. 

Second, the climate change interview. LMAO! They certainly cast that role right. Best part was the response to Will asking if he (the EPA guy) would get in trouble for saying what he said. ""Who cares?""

I don't get why it was the lowest rated episode of that season."

63,"Favorite moment? Just started the series again for like the 100th time. I love this show so much. I want to be friends with all of them.😂 But seriously, so many great moments! 

A personal fave is in ""5/1,"" (s1e7) when Don breaks the news to the captain. OMG.

And the line in ""Bullies"" (s1e6) when Will says, ""Is there any way of knowing if lollipoplollipop is 10 years old... or a basset hound?"" Hahaha I crack up every time. 

What are yours?"
64,"If only the ending didn’t pan that way... I understand that was a convenient time for that to happen but the flashbacks really took away from everything that happened while they were away &amp;amp; I know the execs a dick, but Charlie has more charisma for him to just be so passive in that type of situation smh."
65,"regarding CNN's crossfire So, I happened to pick one YouTube video that featured John Stewart and it of course lead to like 5-6 after that follow and then I learned through his wiki page that he had once appeared on a show called CNN""s Crossfire and told them that they are hurting America and I am curious.  
  
How were crossfire hurting America, from the very little research I have done on them [and I admit, it has been small], Crossfire's premise seemed to be bring on 2 people who know their stuff and are on opposite sides of an issue and let them debate on TV to show both sides of the story as much as possible. Which is basically what Will and the team tried to do. So what was wrong with how Crossfire did it that they were ""hurting America""?"

67,"Will McAvoy doppleganger? So after finishing newsroom for the first time a few months back, I couldn't help but feel that Will McAvoy seemed oddly familiar, but just couldn't put my thumb on it. Then I realized the character had a lot of similarities in his speech delivery as 2 year World News Tonight anchor and longtime Peter Jennings backup Charlie Gibson.  Just look at his closing monologue for his final signoff on Dec 2009:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdmGBGkOKU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdmGBGkOKU4)"
68,"Watching for the first time. Is it me, or... Is it me, or is the writing in S2 getting sloppier and sloppier? Just at the exact right moment, a translator who is churning out tweets so slowly that the guy needing them is complaining for 2 episodes complains non-stop starts blasting tweets through the fax machine JUST as Charlie and McKenzie tell the team that they are pulling the plug on the story of Genoa? Thats the height of lazy writing. "
69,"Missing scenes? I watched Newsroom live as it aired and every single time I watch it now - Netflix, Crave, streaming sites... I can't help but notice there are a few scenes missing.

The most prominent is from the first episode - I clearly remember a scene expanding on the one where Will and Charlie are talking in Charlie's office - it's right before they go to the staff meeting and Will yells ""I'm affable!!""

He yells that because I remember there being an exposition of breakdown. Talking about focus groups and audience opinions of Will before the outburst and of him afterwards.

I'm not crazy right? This scene existed and was cut for whatever reason?"
70,"Just finished binging this for the first time [spoilers] My girlfriend loved it and I’ve heard good things so I jumped right in.

For me season 1 was by far the best. I liked the structure of each episode revolving around a major news story. Getting a handle on the different jobs and how everyone works to put the story on the air was fascinating.

Season 2 somewhat abandons that structure. While I did enjoy it overall, I found myself getting a little irritated at all of the romantic subplots. The only one I really bought into was Will and Mack’s. It wasn’t trying to be a screwball comedy but seemed to be about real people managing real issues.

Season 3 was really hit and miss for me. Maybe it was the fact that it was only 6 episodes but something about it just didn’t flow. Everything sort of seemed half developed: the sale of ACN, Jim confesses his love to Maggie. Will ending up in prison seemed like a stretch considering the screenplay re-emphasized every few minutes that reporters rarely go to jail for not revealing their sources.

All in all I enjoyed it but unfortunately I felt it peaked in season 1. I was invested in the characters and that carried me through to the end but it dropped off rather quickly. Thoughts?"
71,"How S2 should have gone down? TL;DR: If Jerry hadn’t been introduced, who would have been responsible for Genoa? What would the fallout have been?

So, season 2 is my favorite season of the show by far. I loved the big story arc, plus the little arcs the characters had and their development. I like that kind of stuff. But I was reading about the show online, and I see a lot of people complaining about S2. Sometimes the fact that it had a big arc in the first place but also the fact that a new character (Jerry) is the one who fucks everything up. I see people wishing that one of the regulars had cocked up, which I admit is an interesting idea, and one that I wouldn’t have minded seeing. Who do you think would have (or should have) been responsible for the Genoa debacle? How would that character have been handled going forward?"
72,"Regarding Will being a republican. The narrative that mainstream media seems to always want to dole out [Trevor Noah, Colbert report and at times, John Oliver] is that Republicans are ignorant, backwards people who want to kill all immigrants, gays and want your babies to be armed with guns right after birth.  
  
The Newsroom as well as my eventually being fed up with the narrative makes me think that that is not what Republicans are about. This in turn has made me want to find real republican shows that are more logical but's hard to find any show that is like those comedy stuff that I mentioned above and is republican.  
  
When I say is real republican, I am referring to the Republicans that is described Will in the episode where he basically rants to Charlie something about republican of today not representing what it originally was and how it was hijacked by the tea party to become what it is, which basically seems to just be the political party that always seems wrong on every major issue, even some that shouldn't be bipartisan issues.  
  
So, in short, is there any sensical logical current republican shows that are comedic in nature and also find the shiet that the Trump administration does to be infuriating or are Republicans really the villians that the mainstream media makes them out to be?"
73,Ill try to fix you. This scene always gets me... 
74,Out of curiosity: How did Reddit react to this scene on The Newsroom? 
75,"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was Aaron Sorkin’s warm up act for The Newsroom I rewatched The Newsroom and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip back to back a couple of weeks ago and came to the conclusion that Aaron just refined his writing of Studio 60 to produce the masterpiece that is The Newsroom. You can even spot identical lines recycled from studio 60 and put in the newsroom script. The structure of both shows is very similar, from the way they both open, through the relationships between the characters all the way to how the shows develop. That’s not to say they are not both excellent shows, I was just amused by the abundance of similarities. In fact if you haven’t watched studio 60 and you enjoyed the newsroom I highly recommend you check it out. Anyway, as I said, I just think we wouldn’t have had the polished jewel that is the newsroom if it wasn’t for the raw and rough around the edges studio 60 where Aaron got to try what works and what doesn’t in a workplace drama."
76,"bin laden episode how exactly does a murder of bin laden (or gadaffi) qualify as matter of american national security? I'd understand bin laden one if they killed him before 9/11, but after that, he's been hiding in caves, and a threat to no one. meanwhile to say gadaffi was a threat to anyone, a guy who thought he was safe, cause he was ""protecting europe from african migrants"" as he used to self describe, is just plain laughable, gadaffi was a threat smaller than a donut, as on donut you can chip a tooth, or get your blood sugar to soar, but what could have gadaffi ever do to anyone? he was like a kitten who can't see yet...

&amp;#x200B;

the excitement over it all, made no sense to me.oh we killed someone who wronged us 10 years go, go us. but let's make it hush hush, until 10:30, for no reason whatsoever, except to get everyone in state of panic for two hours for no reason whatsoever, and barely any payoff.

&amp;#x200B;

I sure hope that's not how it went down in real life. I can't possibly know, I found out days later. that's how much being the first to break the news out means in 21st century, which makes all this chaos even more insane"
77,"Was this not a fairly significant plot hole in the series finale? I've been looking at a bunch of episodes yet again for the umpteenth time when this occurred to me. Now, I could understand if there was a certain amount of the fandom that wasn't thrilled with the season 3 aka series finale. With all the flashback stuff they put in, that it might've been putting a kind of finer point on the series as a whole than what was needed.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's one particular thing that, far as I can tell, ends up playing as a hard, direct contradiction to what we'd known previously. Of course so much of the drama during season 1 comes from how antagonistic Leona Lansing is toward Will and what they're trying to do on the show once Mac comes back. That she's put off by how Will is genuinely trying to make politicians and other big shots accountable for their behavior (especially it being people whose political help she may need).  In 01x03 in the board room meeting with Charlie, she even says *""What happened to breast cancer, all the human interest stuff? He was great at that shit!""*... *""He was sleeping while doing that shit.""*... *""And whose idea was it to wake him up?""*

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, makes for a compelling face off between two strong personalities during that scene, but here's the problem: during the series finale, we're shown in the flashbacks a moment where Will is still down at Barbados (or whatever island resort he was at) on his vacation after the Northwestern incident, but before he's returned to work. He receives a call at the bar from Leona, her asking him if he's okay, basically making sure he's not having a nervous breakdown or anything. Will says in a very calm, but matter-of-fact way, *""Leona, I'd like to actually finally do the news""*. To which Leona replies ***""So who's stopping you?""*** and then she hangs up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, does that imply (if not very directly suggest) to anyone else that Leona is already right then giving Will the thumbs up, the green light, whatever you wanna call it, to approach the reporting of news in exactly the way he starts to upon returning? It sure as hell seems to me she'd be impressed and even proud that he'd finally become the type of news anchor that he then is for the bulk of the series."

But otherwise, the show is pretty fun and interesting.

Currently on Willie Pete.

Edit: Just finished watching Oh Shenandoah.  The last half of season 3 is like banging my head against the wall repeatedly.

I am now glad the show did not continue.

To clarify, I am definitely glad the show exists and I really enjoyed 2.5 seasons of the show.  It's just that last bit that was headache inducing.

Finale is...ok."
90,"Watched this show when it came out, just started rewatching I first saw The Newsroom when it aired (I think I discovered it through a Facebook video of the infamous Will college speech), and I was in love with it. The 2nd and 3rd seasons fall a little short for me, but those first two seasons hold these deep rooted memories. At the time, the show really inspired me to follow my passion of political science, which I still study. Watching it now, it's a surge of emotions and memories and all sorts of feelings. Such great characters, such great writing and acting. It's great to rewatch and reevaluate how I used to feel about certain topics."

I love the setup, the characters, the writing, and it amazes me how pertinent some of the stuff still is. 

However, above all, what I love the most is Mackenzie Mchale. Emily Mortimer does a fantastic and beautiful job of brining this character to life imo. I can not get enough of her relationship to Will. I love the back and forth, her 'cuteness', and the ultimate love between them. (I can just sense its coming). As the character said about herself, she is 'beautiful, intelligent, and vital'. Kinda makes me jealous, which I had someone like that...(woah, sorry, that topic is for another day)

Anyway, I can't believe the show is so short. I was really bummed to find out that it is only 2.5 seasons, and apparently a lot of stuff went down, that led to it being 'cancelled' 

Anyway, hope this thread is still active, (looks like it) cause I freaking love this show!!1"

Then he gets up again and runs onto the bus, and then the next time you see Daniel mentioned is when the attorney lady asks Maggie if ""he died instantly.""

I've never been able to understand this, and it has always confused me. If someone could explain, I would be grateful :) "

115,"Follow up episodes I just had a thought and figured I’d get other opinions. I love this show and I still go back and watch it almost every year. The show was short and sweet. I know Aaron sorkin states that he no longer wanted to write for TV and focus on Movies. 

But wouldn’t it be nice. If the news group, cast and crew made a single follow up episode each year. They could pick all kinds of new topics to report on from through out the year. We could get a quick update on there lives and where they are at now. Some things have changed, some things never change.  

I’m sure I could go on and on. But Id love to hear if anyone else would enjoy the same thing . "
116,"Blown fact check You know something absolutely minor that bugs the shit out of me, and has since the first time I watched it the first time it aired on HBO like 4 years ago.

In Season 3, when Will and Mac and Charlie and the lawyer go before the government lawyer, and the govt lawyer makes a point to say Nebraska didn't recruit him so he had to go to Texas A&amp;M instead, and the implication is this is for football (strongly because of the guy's size and shape, and because the only sport that matters at Nebraska and A&amp;M is football).  He says he lost to Nebraska all 4 years he was there, and that he hated it (to which Will quips ""really I thought you would have gotten used to it."")  We all know that The Newsroom is a fictional news network with fictional people that exists in our reality; that everything is the same other than these people and this network exist and this is how the cover news, act, interact, etc.

Never, at any point in history, have Nebraska and Texas A&amp;M played each other 4 straight years.  Yes, they were both in the Big XII for awhile, but when they were in the Big XII they were in different divisions and at most played each other twice in 4 years.  And more than that, based on the implied ages of these characters, they would have been at these respective schools long before the Big XII was formed (which was like 1996).

This is minor, and borderline meaningless, but also stupid that they couldn't get it right.  For as much as I LOVE this show, and am now finishing up probably my 5th watch-through of it, it's annoying they couldn't get this right.  It's a detail so simple, I'm amazed not one person on the writing team said anything.  All they would've had to do is change Texas A&amp;M to Oklahoma, one of Nebraska's historical rivals for about 60 years up until 2010 or so.

It has annoyed me for years, and now I'm sharing it with you all.  It's 1:24am central time, and I have a sleeping 16-month old, and I have work in 7 hours.  Don't judge me, I'm watching the episode where Charlie dies."

118,"Just finished season 2 - did sorkin know if he had a season 3 at that point? I loved that a lot of story arcs were wrapped up in the finale. However the last 15 mins or so did seem a little frantic. Maybe it was intentional, or maybe it was rushed, to close as many storylines as possible so if it wasn’t renewed, the viewers had resolution. 
Was season 3 already commissioned at that point?"
119,"Was Jerry Dantana right about Africa? In season 2, he comments to Maggie that Africa is the next place American soldiers will go to die. Is there some proof of that or is he being a little outrageous?"
120,"[Season Three Episode Five] - (Spoilers) When Will was in prison, was he hallucinating? I just rewatched the episode for the third time, and noticed something new. Will has three pictures on the wall; one of Mac, one of the entire gang, and one of young will and his father. During the episode, Will is sharing a prison cell with another man. He has many deep discussions with the man, who knows lots about will. The man even knows that Will was beaten by his father at a young age. 
I thought this was just a coincidence, but at the end of the episode it cuts to will taking down the pictures, and it is revealed his father in the picture was the same man in the cell. 
Then, I looked up the post show interview on HBO with Sorkin, where he reveals that it was Will’s father all along.
So yes- will was hallucinating that he was seeing his dad after over 50 days in solitary. I feel like this is an amazing piece of writing by Sorkin and staff, as it was a physical interpretation of the main conflict within Will over the 2.5 previous seasons. "
121,Just finished season 1. My question is a spoiler for others so it’s in comments Why does Solomon Hancock kill himself? And did he give Charlie the evidence or was it really beef stew. Sorry if I’m being dense

129,"the lawywr is terrible In season 2 and the staff keeps getting into trouble over things Jerry is trying to do to get them to settle.

As a lawyer who said she is looking at a 17 million dollar apartment and is obviously successful and good at what she does presumebly why does she not prep the staff for potential trouble they can into by saying or doing certain things by predicting the legal strategies by Jerry and his lawyers?

I've worked with many corporate lawyers and they spend a lot of time addressing possible outcomes and instructing clients what to watch out for.

An example is when Jerry calls for a job reference knowing they'll give a terrible one and in not warning them about this strategy they get sued again.

What's her deal? No competent lawyer would realistically not see this coming or worse not instruct their clients to watch what they say if and when Jerry's next legal move is executed.

Is she terrible or is this just bad writing? It's so basic. "
130,"In the middle of season 2 and the episodes are jumping all over the time line and I'm confused. Going from episode 7 to episode 8 it seems like we jumped back to weirdo maggies hair when before it was longer and blonde. I'm getting losts as to whats happening and when. Why would they make this so confusing?

Tonight future Hall Of Famers Daniel and Henrik Sedin, a pair of Swedish identical twins who have played together their entire careers played their final game. At the end of the game as the home team Edmonton Oilers gave a very classy send off where the whole team stayed on the ice to congratulate them on their long and storied careers, the PA was playing I Will Fix You.

As someone who mostly hates freaking Coldplay, I think I have to make an exception to this song, because it seems no matter when it gets played I fall apart in tears, between the show and now tonight's game.

Blast you Sorkin and Oilers, for making me love that goddamn band."

So on 5/1, Charlie recounts a story about how Iraqis were using his TV broadcast to range their missiles on Tel Aviv in 1991 - is there any real life inspiration for this incident or a similar incident where one country's force used live news TV to range their missile attacks or other attacks?"

141,"BlackBerry continuity error? I'll start off by saying I'm a pretty big nerd, and I have a strange interest in phones and tech of the sort. Something has been bothering me about season 1 of the show. 

The first BlackBerry Bold 9900/9930 I have found is in S1E6, where the date is announced to be April 11, 2011. You can see Mack holding one in her left hand after she pulls Jim and Maggie out of the rundown early in the episode. There may be earlier instances, but there are plenty of later ones that come before BlackBerry released the 9900 line in November of that year. When I saw her holding one, it stuck out to me as quite odd.

My question is why a show so focused on timeline continuity and so many close up scenes with mobiles would let something like that happen. Would a news company like ACN have early access to phones like this? Also has anyone else noticed similar continuity errors?"

143,Still a little Will McAvoy in Jeff Daniels 
144,I'm currently watching The West Wing at the moment and got to the end of Season 2 so made this meme relating to Newsroom. Spoilers for series finale of Newsroom and S02E22 of WW. 
145,Just finished rewatching the series for the first time since it aired. This is still by far my favourite scene 
146,"Is Will is an astronomy enthusiast? In Season 1 he explains to Mack how the Apollo 13 crew survived. This knowledge could be explained by it being a huge news event in his life, but, in Season 2 he knows more than Sloane about the analogy she is trying to use about recent 'Goldilocks planet' discoveries. Then again in Season 2, he explains to Rebecca Halliday exactly how the *Challenger* disaster happened. 

I was discussing the show with a friend and he made the point that characters in Sorkin shows tend to always know the information in conversations like they had prepared for every conversation beforehand. 

He may have been right about some of Sorkin's dialogue but I think Will is actually an astronomy enthusiast. What other hobbies do the characters in the show secretly have that you've noticed? "
147,"Office Lighter? through out the show he uses a unique lighter to light his cigs. I was wondering if any of you happened to know what kind of lighter it was. I know it makes the sound of a zippo in the show, but I'm almost 90% its not. Any help would be much appreciated.
"
148,"Any Dunder Mifflin fans here? I’ve started watching The Office (yeah, just recently!) and I’m around Season 5. I’ve noticed a few things:

- Ryan is Lucas Pruitt
- Toby is the Deputy Admin of the EPA
- Up Chickens game that the staff was playing at the party

I’m guessing Sorkin is a Dunder Mifflin fan too :D

Are there any other things common between the shows?"
149,"I just watched Aaron Sorkin's film Molly's Game and I really miss this show. Yeah, that's all. "
150,"Season 2: In the Jim &amp; Maggie storyline, Jim is soooo pathetic I'm not a fan of the whole ""Jim and Maggie"" thing - I think it's a high school romance in the middle of a graduate-level commentary on news &amp; politics. 

But the scene where Jim whines ""Mac, fire me or send me to New Hampshire"" may be the absolute lowest point of the entire series. I mean - seriously? ""I can't do my job because that girl I like is dating some other guy""? 

I tried that shit in college after a bad breakup until my roommates kicked my ass and told me to get back to studying. "
151,"something I never understood about the ACN reaction to Will calling the Tea Party the American Taliban..... alot of The Newsroom was about holding people responsible for their rhetoric, something that Maggie even says when discussing the candidate who claims she can talk to God.  
  
If that is the case, then how come the people at ACN don't see the issue with Will calling the Tea Party the American Taliban? It seems kinda hypocritical to me. They rail against figures of speech designed to distract and hoodwink the people but then Will claims that an American Political Party is akin to a terrorist organization and they dont see anything wrong with that?"
152,What was the drinking game that the crew were doing at the party at Will's place for one year of Newsnight 2.0 and when Will eats several pot brownies (episode 1x07)? They had beer bottles on the table and they were getting their elbows on the table and clapping?
153,"Don drunk before his show. So what was rewatching episode 3 of season 1, and after Will's apology Don comes in and talks to Jim, he says he saw the news broadcast at a bar and that he may have been over-served. Why the fuck was Don at a bar and not getting ready for his show with Elliot?"
154,"Extra documents Why in season 3 episode 1 did Neal ask the source for more documents? He already had 27,000 of them."
155,You’ll never watch an episode the same way again. Every single door in the office makes the exact same sounds.
156,The way he looks at Dantana... 
157,"Huckleberry-bad writing I just watched S3 E3 again (for the millionth time - I love season 3) and I still don't understand the line ""Huckleberry-bad writing"". This is Charlie's line in response to Mac reading the article from the year before when Will goes off on the White House Correspondents Dinner, calling it the ""saturnalia of incestuous ingratiation that does little to instill confidence in the public that the press isn't ensorcelled by the powerful"". 

I can only assume that it's a reference to Huckleberry Finn, but aren't those books literary classics? Are they actually considered bad writing? Or is it a reference to something else?"
158,"When did Will work on-air at CNN? I just finished rewatching the series and it's revealed in the last episode that Mac and Will worked together at CNN, albeit for a short period of time. While this takes care of why Charlie and her had never met before the bowling alley, it doesn't add up with the story presented earlier in the series, where Will's first appearance on-air was on the night of 9/11.

Am I missing something? Am I putting the puzzle together incorrectly? Or was this really the insanely obvious continuity error I think it might be?"
159,"I don't think Sorkin ever read Don Quixote Okay, this is not a complete argument or even a complete thought, but stay with me. I'm 18, so I was (fairly) young when Newsroom first aired. Since it went off, I actually read Don Quixote by Cervantes and absolutely loved it. Changed my life.

Now I'm rewatching, and they get a lot of things wrong! From what I can gather, it seems like every Don Quixote reference is really just a reference to the musical ""Man of La Mancha"", which isn't really an adaptation but more of a story about the story.

In the pilot, Will corrects Mac by pointing out she had quoted the musical, not the book. But seconds later he corrects her statement on his steed by saying he rode a donkey, not a horse. This isn't true, he rode a horse named Rocinante (Sancho rode a donkey). He even reiterates this later with Charlie.

In a later episode (S1E10), Will talks about how Quixote was defeated by the Knight of the Mirrors, as he showed the protagonist who he really was. This happens in the musical, but in the book the Knight of the Mirrors is actually defeated by Quixote and is in fact also a man dressed in fake armor. At the end of the episode he gets up from the hospital bed reciting the words ""What is illness to the body of our knight errant? What matter wounds?"" and Charlie says he's reciting the end of Don Quixote.

Nope. It's from the musical.

Now obviously none of this is of consequence, the show is still compelling and I appreciate the references. And who knows, maybe it's the characters just fucking up. But it's become a small peeve that it seems as though Sorkin (a known musical theater fan) is making references to classic literature, only using knowledge from the musical ""adaptation"".

And I guess I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy.

EDIT: Fun side note, I just remembered that my username is literally evidence of my love for Don Quixote."
160,Just watched s1 e3 and the whole deal about the republicans moving right is now kinda terrifying... 
161,"Highest Rated Episode on IMDB - given the hate it got, I found this a tad surprising. "
162,"Possible meaning for Yosemite If you listen to Jeff Daniels rant when he screams out Yosemite
It's a contraction for ""you see what I mean""
"
163,"the voter ID laws in the greater fool confused me... when they investigate the voter ID laws that were passed to ensure that only people who were actually citizens of America could vote, they portray it as a negative thing. They went on to say that its being implemented with an agenda of making sure certain citizens who's votes arent what some candidates want cant vote.  
  
I am confused on why certain citizens dont have govt ID. in the episode they used the case of an elderly Tennesse resident who cant vote because she doesnt have a passport because she never planned to travel overseas and doesnt have a drivers license because she never learned to drive. in Canada, at least in British Columbia, we have 2 different govt IDs that we can use for identification besides a drivers' license or a passport. BCID which as the name suggests is is just a card to provide a person with a govt ID in case they dont have a license as well as the card we use for Medical Services Plan which is tied to our Medical information [ie health insurance and so forth]. Ive never seen someone who doesn't have some type of identification and even my grandmother who indeed never learned to drive and doesnt use her passport for day to day ID still has a BCID and the Medical Services Card just for day to day identification purposes.  
  
Which makes me wonder if its fair of this Tennesse woman to be upset that she cant vote when to me it seems like its actually her fault because she never bothered to get the proper ID. unless, in America, or Tennessee, they dont have the same ability to get a govt ID that isnt tied to their driving capacity?"
164,"for anyone who wants to watch the newsroom online, pm me i put them on my google drive but its against reddit policy to have those types of link advertised so i cant post it to this sub"
165,"Anybody know where to stream The Newsroom? Hulu used to have it, but it appears that they no longer offer the show, which is disappointing. "
166,"Life long west wing fan here... Finally watched the first episode of the news room. Holy shit. I got the same shivers that I did when I watched Bartlet make his intro to Al Caldwell, Mary marsh and John van dyke. I can see myself binging the whole show really quickly and think I'll become a regular here, so just saying hi!    


Also...Aaron Sorkin is too good of a writer. I'm going to watch everything he's done after I'm through with this "
167,Help me find the episode where we learn Sloan has two PhD's? 
168,Chapo Trap House watching The Newsroom 
169,"Is AWN supposed to be a conglomerate like GE or something? In the first episode of Season 3, Reese is explaining to Sloan why AWN's earnings won't meet projections, and one of the reasons is that Qantas and Lufthansa decided to go with Rolls-Royce engines on the new Boeing aircraft (presumably, given the timeframe and the fact that there are multiple engine options available, the 787--the 747-8 entered service around the same time, but only has one engine option...OTOH, neither Qantas nor Lufthansa operate the 787, though Lufthansa does have the 748 in its fleet).

The other real-world engine option for the 787, besides the RR Trent 1000, is the General Electric GEnx.  I'm struggling to think of how AWN could be affected by what two airlines chose as the engine option for their aircraft purchases unless AWN was itself in the commercial aircraft engine market..."
170,"Similarities to today It's crazy how season 1 alone touches on some of the stuff we are actually going through now. Whether it's mentioning Breitbart, an interviewee talking about building a wall, etc. Rewatching it now is crazy and kinda sad.  "
171,"I just started watching this show and it seems great but incredibly sexist. I love the writing and acting, but it seems so far that the primary motivation for female characters is romance or vindictiveness. Is this a common complaint?  I'm not very familiar with Sorkin's work, but it makes an amazing show hard to watch."
172,"Just finished The Newsroom looking for recommendations Title Pretty much Says it all. Anything that has the same sort of feeling as The Newsroom would be awesome.

I've already listed The Westewing and Aaron Sorkin;s other stuff. 
Please and Thanks!"
173,"Why did people not like The Newsroom? Most of the stories they told about Republicans and the Tea Party were true. The Tea Party was/is dangerous. 

Feels like some people were intimidated by the intelligence of some of the characters. Is that why?"
174,"Can someone tell me what Sorkin did wrong in Oh Shenandoah? This episode is incredibly controversial because of the conversations between Don and Mary, but for the life of me I do not know why. 
Mary is right about the pamphlets, about the advice, she has an answer for everything Don says. Don points out there are two sides, that allowing anonymous posts on the internet that accuse people of heinous crimes sets a dangerous precedent (which I think has been proven repeatedly since then) and Mary responds with her point of view - that it is a public service, that she feels she has a duty. She even admits it might be used for revenge - a fake story - but she believes it is still worth it. 
He also tries to protect her from being humiliated on national television (and does anyone think that her facing off against her rapist would end well for her?) and points out that if we believe accused murderers get the benefit of the doubt, why not accused rapists?
Given that Sorkin is credited as the chief writer, it is likely he wrote both sides of the dialog, so while he wrote Don's lines, he also wrote Mary's. 
I have watched this a dozen times, and I cannot see what he did wrong. Given that the show is all about presenting both sides of a story, that News Night 2.0 is about presenting facts (which both Don and Mary do) and letting the audience (in this case - us) decide for themselves, then how else could it have been written? Should he have only presented one side (Mary's side? Or Don's side?) to the story? Would that have made it better?"
175,Look what I found... 
176,"Does this show get more tolerable? I just finished the first season and I'm wondering if I should keep going. I love the concept of the show and the storylines are great, but the acting and dialogue is killing it for me.


I know the fast-talking characters are Sorkin's thing, and I loved the West Wing, but this feels different. I like Allison Pill in other stuff but can't stand her in this, same with Emily Mortimer. 


Does it get any better?"
177,I just saw The Belko Experiment. Can anyone else believe that Jim is a serial killer? 
178,Is Joe Scarborough the new Will McAvoy? 
179,Wouldn't it be nice if just one of our real-life news organizations came out and said and then DID this? 
180,"Is there a video or gif of the scene where Will talks about why they run so many pieces critical of Republicans? The one where a guest speaker waa talking about their show posting so many negative stories about republicans to democrats. Will counters with its not because we intentionally criticise Republicans it's because for every 1 thing a democrat does, Republicans does more of it. Or something like that"
181,Did Sorkin ever talk about/address who Will's source was on Genoa? 
182,"Did Maggie and Jim get married? The wiki says they did, but did they?"
183,"True Story. Charlie: ""We aired a doctored tape in support of a fake report. The guy who doctored the tape is suing us. The woman who's always wanted to fire us won't let us resign. The unhappiest guy in the building is in-charge of morale. WE HAVE GONE TO THE ZOO!""

Will: ""True Story. *(yeah)* . Which is more than what we can say about the story.""

Oh, Sorkin, you seduce me with your words."
184,"Something about this show I am on my 3rd or 4th rewatch..Just starting season 2

Something about this show...this is the way news is supposed to be...this show makes me feel fucking good...on my darkest days with depression and anxiety, this show helps me.

I know that may sound silly, but oh well.

As far as I am concerned, this show should still be on TV

"
185,"Is there a show today that emulates what News Night did? I'm talking about going after the real issues, and trying to inform the viewers. Seems most news outlets still give us the same partisan spins, and play to fear and what is popular, not necessarily newsworthy. Something online could work as well! "

187,Hanging up Newsroom quotes in the newsroom [x-Post from r/TelevisionQuotes] 
188,"Does anyone know what episode and have a gif or youtube video of a certain scene? I am looking for the scene where someone criticizes the liberal media for airing so many of the Republican blunders saying it is a media bias, but they counter with if Republicans do 99 things wrong and Democrats do 1 thing wrong of course its going to look like a bias."
189,"On my first run-through, Season 3, and I ended up shouting...... **""Son of a bitch, they f*in McGarry'ed Skinner didn't they.""**
    
Did they really have to go with the stress induced heart attack? Felt so cheap.


  Also fuck that music they picked. "
190,"Pls help me find a half remembered Newsroom quote Haven’t seen the series since it aired years ago, and I’m trying to remember a point McAvoy made about sports reporting.  Anyone with an encyclopedic knowledge of the dialog (or willing to fast forward through the series again) recall the back and forth about Sports? 

I’m not talking about the “You mean like trying out for a team?” line, although that might be the setup for it.  It was about how important issues and developments were being covered as though they were sporting events — this political team scored these points (votes), that jury scored those points (damages), this company scored a touchdown (earnings report), and that without covering the issues it all devolves into sports coverage.  

Sorkin wrote some dialog that said it better.  I’d love to track it down again. "
191,"DAE think there is too much physical abuse from the ladies on this show? MacKenzie is the worst at this in my opinion, she is constantly beating on Will in the first season. I get that it can be jokey at times, but she literally punches Will after he almost dies from depression telling him to get over it. 

Also Sloan breaks her Ex's nose for posting nudes. Which was funny and cathartic but totally too far, right?

I think Sorkin handles most issue with a lot of care and finesse, but there is definitely too much Female on Male abuse on this show. "
192,In season 2 Mac gives Maggie $100 before Maggie leaves for her trip to Uganda. With the money Mac says 'you either come back with the money or a story about where it went.' Is this a real journalism superstition? Or just a Sorkin creation? 
193,I bet every newsroom right now is REALLY making sure this sarin story is true 
194,"In defense of the ""elites?"" (Potential SPOILERS) So I've watched Newsroom all the way through and especially after listening to the conversation between (SPOILER ALERT) Will and his dad in the prison cell in the last season, I came to the conclusion that The Newsroom seemed to be offering a defense against the anti-""elites"" rhetoric that so often was used by the Tea Party, Occupy movements and, in today's world, Donald Trump supporters and populist movements. 

Sorkin seemed to be positing that the people we think of as ""elite"" are not to be reviled and made into the enemy, but rather are just normal, everyday people who are in their positions because they earned them, not simply because they ""knew somebody"" or were living in their ""ivory tower, etc.""

What do you guys think? Am I way off here? "
195,"Source on this quote by Will McAvoy ""In the infancy of mass communications, the Columbus and Magellan of broadcast journalism, William Paley and David Sarnoff, went down to Washington to cut a deal with Congress. Congress would allow the fledgling networks free use of taxpayer-owned airwaves in exchange for one public service. That public service would be one hour of air time set aside every night for informational broadcasting, or what we now call the evening news.""

I've looked all over to get a source for this. I've looked at Wikipedia articles on Paley, Sarnoff, and the Federal Communications Act of 1934, but I've found nothing on the fact that networks had to provide a 1-hr news broadcast. I'm super interested in this topic, but I really want to have some sources other than Aaron Sorkin.
"
196,Cool Small detail [Spoilers] A detail I noticed upon rewatching The Newsroom is that during Election Night parts I and II the poster in Don's office is constantly kept out of frame and hidden by people/objects until Sloan sees it. 
197,Real time with Bill Maher has Bill McKibben on its panel last Friday. The conversation between the host and guest very much reminded me of Will's interview of an EPA official in the show. 
198,The Trump interview you didn't know you wanted. 
199,What does Mackenzie mime in the first episode end? She mimes something to Jim at the end of the first episode (season  1). What is it??

202,"Hamish Linklater deserves an award for his portrayal as Jerry Dantana in Season 2 Because every time I watch the Genoa story, I want to strangle Dantana. He's so obviously rabid to find a story to embarrass the US military. "
203,"Just finished watching it. Watched three season in two and a half days, slept for a total of 5 hours cause I had to balance school and stuff and I am completely mesmerised. I cant remember when a character dying hit me more than the death of Charlie Skinner."
204,"How I felt about the ending The newsroom was a show that described what I would like an ideal media to be like: bold, unafraid, and always ready to call out bullshit when it needed to be done.



It wasn't just about that, though: I grew very attached to the characters. The drama, the romance, all of it. It was just so good to see how their lifes played out even out of the newsroom. That's the main reason I binge watched it... I hadn't watched a show like that in a long time.



It was awesome to see conservatives get called out on a lot of their non-sensical views, it was awesome to watch the never ending struggles happening all the time with all the characters: Jim-Maggie, Don-Sloan, Will-Mackenzie romances, Charlie and everyone always doing their best to just do a good show, that informed people instead of sacrificing actual important information for the sake of audience. 

Yes, it was a bit pretentious and almost arrogant sometimes, but that's what it needed to be and a lot of people in the real world do need to be called out on their opinions (because it often happens that their ""opinion"" goes against logic and even facts), and the show did an awesome job at that. There are a lot that would say the show took actual events with the benefit of hindsight (which I don't consider a bad thing), or that a great part of the show was just Aaron Sorkin being verysmart... I don't really agree.

That being said, I felt like the end was fitting: life goes on, those struggles will continue to be never ending and everyone will keep figthing the good fight. I wish Charlie hadn't died and thought it was downright shitty to have him agreeing to all the shit Ryan (don't remember the actual characters name, just thought of the name from the office) did, but he died fighting. The ending even gave the show a chance for revival, even though that's very unlikely to happen. Eventually they ran out of real news, and it would be shitty to make them up just so the show could go on.

Since you asked me to tag you, here you go, /u/HaqpaH! "

208,"Found something that kinda fills the void I just started watching the shows from the last few months, and stumbled upon one that sounded similar in theme at least to the newsroom, so added it to my watching list. It's called Graves and it features a American President who was in the job a while before, strong conservative who has come to regret his decisions and policies. Starting wars, being homophobic, punishing illegals harder and stripping medical funding are some of the things he did that he has come to regret and is trying to make amends for.
Its nowhere like for like, Graves is much more political and less of a mission, no mission to civilize like Will had, just a old guy who wants to try and make amends and right the wrongs he caused. It is also a lot gaudier and low brow than the Newsroom. Though the fire is there and the passion that the Newsroom has. Its against a backdrop of a wife considering accepting a offer to run for a political office and the two kids having their own issues.

I'd highly suggest people take a look at it, its likely not for everyone but I'm enjoying it. Does anyone else have any similar shows for to check out?"
209,"The identity of Will's source for Genoa I was just rewatching the second season of the show yesterday. During the Genoa crisis, Will also had a source that corroborated the story, and although all the other sources were revealed and proven wrong, Will's source was never mentioned again. I watched the particular episode again, and can't recall any scene that explicitly mentions who Will's source was and how they got the information wrong.

I recently started rewatching from the beginning with the intention of finishing three.  I'm halfway through two right now.  I love the show.  It is especially poignant now.  My biggest take away though is that Olivia Munn is so damn good.  The scene with Sloane and Charlie in the first season after she uses off the record information is one of my favorite scenes of any TV show I've seen.  Then the episode where pics of her are released, she is just brilliant.  I hope she has a role in the near future that catapults her to the forefront of today's young actresses.  I don't believe there is a role out there that she could not handle.  She is hilarious, yet capable of hitting those dramatic moments as well."

It's still as true today as it was when the episode aired (S2E09) &gt;I call myself a republican because I am one. I believe in market solutions. I believe in common sense realities, and the necessity to defend ourselves against a dangerous world, and that’s about it. Problem is, now I have to be homophobic. I have to count the number of times people go to church. I have to deny facts, and think scientific research is a long con. I have to think poor people are getting a sweet ride. And I have to have such a stunning inferiority complex that I fear education and intellect – in the 21st century. But most of all, the biggest new requirement, really the only requirement, is that I have to hate Democrats.

He got caught because Neil and Terry Crews baited him out by claiming Neal posted the death threat and the actual guy got mad and revealed who he was and got caught off screen? Is that right or was it never resolved? I feel Sorkin sometimes just does not finish story lines like in West Wing. Though I guess S2 was shorter though so maybe it was cut "
239,"Just finished the series. I enjoyed it but I had one problem... Will is most definitely a RINO (Republican In Name Only). It seemed like he called himself a Republican throughout the whole show, yet never once did I see him do or say anything that a Republican would. Even the left side of the Republican party greatly supported Romney, and the way Will attacked him incessantly was uncanny for someone claiming to be a Republican. It just gave a feeling of inauthenticity to the show, especially since Sorkin had written good Republican characters in the West Wing.

Did this trouble anyone else?"
240,"Can you imagine what a Season 4 about this election would have looked like?

244,"Don's jacket S1E9 In episode 9 of the first season (Blackout II), Don is in three scenes.  In the first, he walks into Will's office to pick up the flowers delivered for him.  The second is the mock debate.  The third is in Lisa and Maggie's apartment at the end of the episode.  In all three scenes he is wearing a jacket or sweater.  The reason this is notable is because as Reese mentioned in Blackout I this is supposed to be the hottest this particular day in NYC has ever been.

In the first scene, Will even asks Don why he is wearing the jacket and Don responds that his own office is ""Ice station zebra.""  In the second scene all of the candidate representatives are wearing sweaters so no note is made.  In the third scene he walks into the room rubbing his hands together saying something about not being able to fix the AC so they are stuck with either ""90 degrees or 30.""  I guess the assumption is that it is currently 30 because of his thick jacket, but Maggie is wearing a very thin sweater and Lisa's outfit is sleeveless.

I'm probably nitpicking about a minor detail but it's bothering me.  I just find it odd that he is the only one dressed this way and the show seemed to go out of it's way to throw in a line at the beginning of each scene explaining why he was.  Was something going on with Thomas Sadoski while they were filming the episode?"

He claims that Don Quixote never rode a horse and instead rode a donkey. Throughout the book Don Quixote does in fact ride a horse, albeit a scrawny and sickly horse. It is Sancho Panza that rides a donkey. I know its a minor detail to nitpick, but I have a great deal respect for Aaron Sorkin (longtime fan of west wing, sports night, and the newsroom) and Don Quixote's steed is such a significant part of the book that it seems the only way he could make this mistake is if he never actually read it himself. It just seems so unlike Aaron Sorkin to extensively use the themes of a book he seemingly never read"

What was the mass grave from the NGO report? Was Hamni8 describing Genoa? And if so, what was the white smoke and why was everyone dead?

And maybe it's just because I've watched it so many times, but there are so many points where the plot just falls apart. For example, why wouldn't Will and Charlie have made sure they didn't have the same source?"
264,"Is The Newsroom Sorkin's greatest work of television? I've just completed re-re-re-(etc)-watching the show and I had a thought. Sports Night was good. The West Wing was phenomenal. Studio 60 had real promise but was cut short. The Newsroom had time to grow and explore some interesting arcs. For me, The West Wing will always be the absolute pinnacle but I think due in equal measure to the cast and to the writing.

Considering only the seasons of WW that Sorkin wrote (up to S4 I think) which show would you say is the absolute best example of his televisual writing, and why?

IMO, The Newsroom wins handily. It had some great snappy banter that was in some ways missing in S60, which was for a long time my benchmark for good writing. It didn't ever rely on the tried-and-tested walk &amp; talk that by now is a trope. The stories were interesting and the behind-the-scenes look at reports on real life events made it more real, like it was a true fly-on-the-wall type show. The way you could see Will put his psyche back together over the course of the show. Genius.

I love WW, I love S60, but Newsroom is my new favourite Sorkin show.

I'm watching it via Kodi, and as I begun season 3, I accidentally hovered over the series finale, and I saw part of the first sentence of the episode synopsis, which is ""a sudden death leads Will and Mac to..."" that's as far as I got before realizing what I was doing.

I knew it would be Charlie. I was hoping I'd be wrong, and maybe, perhaps Maggie would be the one to die.

I was cheering on Sloane as she was ripping apart not-Neal about the Gawker Stalker thing he was in charge of.

Then down comes Charlie to tear holes in Mac and Sloane. That's when I realized Charlie only has seconds before he drops. I knew it was coming, and when it did happened, I still jumped and teared up. It was made worse by Charlie hitting his head on the way down. And then they had to rip off his bow tie.

And then they let us in on the fact that Will never had a cell mate at all, and he was just talking to his dead father.

And now he's free, and everything is fine! Except for the part that Charlie is dead!

On to the finale episode, which I hope will leave me an emotional wreck."

For some reason I have this fear that those episodes won't be of the same caliber as what I've seen so far (since the show didn't continue), and I'll regret having watched them.

So I found the Season two storyline kind of confusing and actually re-watched it.

Not that I think in the long run Will's source would've been mattered, but is still kind of intrigues me that it was mentioned but never really confirmed. The only thing I recall is Will saying, ""it's not POTUS, it's better than POTUS."" 

I remember in season one he had a text from Biden or something, which if I was in Will's position I would consider just as good as POTUS, But I couldn't imagine Biden feeding Will that much disinformation.  

The only theory that I came up with is that Will is a smart guy and figured out what was going on and wanted the story to air, so he lied about having the source to make everyone (i.e. charlie) super comfortable with it airing."

For one I couldn't believe that after so long they were still discussing this case and that they even had the nerve to hire actors to supposedly reenact the interactions between those people.  
One thing that got to me was when they were trying to portray Casey as the anti-Christ, they hit on a bunch of the things that Don keefer had pointed out was essential to twist the situation to make Casey look guilty. That was interesting to me.

2. Did the EPA director make up a fake interview to take revenge on Maggie? But if so was the report fake too?

296,"Just finished my first watch. Spoilers all. The first season was one of the best put on television.  Will's opening scene is in the top five of any movie or T.V. show.  It really was Aaron Sorkin at some of his best.  Just about every scene had a reason to be there, whether it was to advance the plot or fill in back story.  Everything just clicked to make it a phenomenal season.

First half of season two was almost as good as season one.  I cant really put my finger on why I wasnt as excited as watching the first season.  I can say that the moment I audibly said ""this is where he lost it"" when Leona showed up high in ep 7.  It was great to see Jane Fonda act like that, but the whole thing seemed forced.  Knowing that the show was on a limited run, I felt that was the beginning of the end.  There were three distinct  moments I had to look away.  The show went from captivating to cringe inducing. (I'm sorry to use that word, but that the best way to describe it.) And goddamn, do I want to punch B.J. Novac in the face every time I see him.  So good at playing a douche.

Now we get the grand send off.  Six episodes for Sorkin to shine and give us all an amazing ending.  What do we get?  Another death only to create drama.  But it's ok because Will and Mac are having a baby.  And you want to use a good portion of your last 65 minutes for each main characters ACN origin story.  

I can see why there are only 25 episodes.  It had the possibility to run as long as West Wing did.  He just lost the thread 3/4ths of the way through the second season.  I think it would have lasted a lot longer if he didnt try to make it so complicated.  There will be recommendations it to anyone who hasnt seen it because the good parts are just so damn good.  "

I thought Bill Nye, The Science Guy, was also an actor who played Charlie Skinner in The Newsroom. And I guess I thought there was some continuation with the colorful bowties across his life and playing this character.

It just now occurred to me that these are two different people. Mind blown.

Because when he left the cell, he looked back, no one will there and the bed was still made up. 
Will's dad was an alcoholic drunk who beat his mother until he was able to stand up too him."
313,"Jim and Maggie A belated question regarding Jim and Maggie. The series seemingly ends with the two finally together. But during the flashbacks, we learned that Jim previously had a long-term relationship, which did not work out. And indeed, during the show, we see Jim attempt a long-term relationship, which doe not work out. Now Jim says that this time it'll work because he's truly in love, and I took that at face value when I watched the finale. Jim was in love with MacKenzie while overseas, after all, and he was in love with Maggie while back home.

But a thought occurred to me today -- is it possible that, in fact, we're just seeing Jim enter into another long-term relationship that will fail? We've seen Jim fail pretty consistently at maintaining relationships in the show. I know some have suggested that the main story of the show is the Jim and Maggie love story (it's what ties together the full series, from beginning to end), but is it possible that in fact, the show has foreshadowed a less than good end to this love story?

I love watching and rewatching the Newsroom and I'm watching Season 3 now and as stated in the title, I really am having a problem sympathizing with and/or liking Neil as well as feeling that ACN was in the right morally.  

* First off.  I don't like how naive he is with the receiving of the data.  A guy like that should know what is right/wrong when it comes to this data.
* I don't like how he tries to be all tough with Will in Episode 2.  Wanting to go to jail is self indulgent and a way to get manufactured credibility.   
* I think that he and Will should absolutely have given up the source and making them seem like heroes.  Not to say what was done by the marketing company was acceptable, but the FBI was right in that the source could have spilled information that could put assets in the field in jeopardy.   
* Mac was the only one that acted admirably in that she threatened the source that she will reveal her if she doesn't give them the time to vet everything.  
* Will saying he ""couldn't give the source"" is just NOT a true statement.  He didn't want to.  Simple as that.  There was nothing meta-physically stopping him from doing so.  Him not verifying it after her death was him being a dick.  He could have easily done so ""via the side door"" as his lawyer put it to end it all.   He was totally wrong.  
* Neil was a SUPER DICK at the end when he told that one guy he was ashamed of him.  The guy just was doing his job that the new ownership wanted him to do.  He was embarrassed by Sloan on TV because she is friends with Erin Andrews.  He comes back from Venezuela after committing espionage and he is ashamed of him?   

Again, love the show but it's sometimes very hard being a fan of Sorkin with stuff like this.  He was like this in Studio 60 as well (very preachy about the Christian Right/Hannah) but was much more even handed on the West Wing.  

Anyway, just my observations after watching this again."

In every other one of Sorkin's shows there has been an episode narrated by a character while writing a letter to a family member (Sports night ""Dear Louise"" west wing ""the stackhouse filibuster"") I also do not remember is studio 60 had one or not.  However, did the newsroom have an episode like this?"

Thoughts?"
334,"Neil Sampat ... a bit unrealistic ? Just a thought i wanted to share. 
Neil starts the show as a blog writer for Will, which is completely credible for a journalist that knows a thing or two about the web.
Later on, apparently he got promoted to handling the entire ACN website operation (one man gig?, kind of an over reach, but still believable). 
The next step is the one that throws  me off. He becomes a hacktivist computer wiz with the ability to create encryptions that are even difficult to crack for the FBI? 
Someone with those types of skills wouldn't be working for a cable network for sure. 
Lets say that he stays with the network just because of the bigger picture. He wanted  to use his skills for the greater good. 
However, if he had all these skills from the moment he enters ACN, before ""the mission to civilize"" starts, 
why da fuq would he accept a job as a blog writer? 
I had to share the thought, the idea kept on bothering me after finishing the show. "

http://np.reddit.com/r/Thenewsroom/comments/2lu24j/if_i_love_the_newsroom_should_i_go_watch_the_west/
asking if I should watch the west wing.
Well, the responses were overwhelmingly in favor of me getting off my ass and watching the west wing immediately, which brings me to the first ""I hate you guys"" because my thoughts after a few episodes were along the lines of ""7 seasons, 22 episodes a season, what have I gotten myself into?!?""
Of course I fairly quickly became obsessed with the show, and am still amazed that I never discovered it when it was new to TV, leading me to ""I love you guys"" for introducing me to it.
But, sadly, last night I finally watched the last (three) episodes.  and now I hate everyone and everything for not having new West Wing episodes in my life anymore!  Woe is me! What do I do now?!

Anyway, thanks all for getting me on board with the West Wing.  I truly found it to be some of the best television I've ever watched, and not one minute of it was wasted.

I don't think I've ever watched a show where every single character was interesting, superbly well-cast and likeable in some way to me. Also there was not one episode that felt slow or like a filler episode. I watched the series finale last night and I'm legit depressed it's over now.

If you're feeling extra speculative I could easily see Will saying they should run them uncensored, and probably taking news outlets who censored them to task on air. Do you think he'd be in favor of running them uncensored and if so do you think he'd criticize news outlets who hadn't? "

It did what I expected but deviated with inane, unnecessary subplots. 

What it should have been was simply News Night and behind the scenes of the show. Have a breaking news drama (that actually entered the broadcast - how was that not done?). Have a subplot with Will's father's death. Have the bullshit twitter thing. Have the Genoa story arc expanded upon.

I was expecting a production-side/on-air broadcast plot only. It would have been great. 

Why did they fluff up the episode with the nudie pic sideplot? The lengthy timeline disparity is confusing as hell, especially with Maggie having her exact usual haircut after the end of the previous ep being her cutting it off and appearing at the examination. 

I appreciate the human drama, but to cut it out to simply show the news would have been interesting and in line with the theme of the show. This episode could have been special and different and standalone but they mucked it up.

I love Sorkin and I love pretty much everything he writes, probably because most writers attempt to hide their style in the things they write, while I feel like Sorkin embraces it. I used to avoid reading all the internet hate about the newsroom but I've finally gotten to the point where I seek them out because they make me laugh to no end. There's something perverse about reading people cry about something that brings me such joy lol. Has anybody else gotten to this point?"
400,[S03E06] Classic Sloan 
401,"[Spoiler] Review: The Newsroom Series Finale, “What Kind of Day Has it Been” "
402,"[Spoilers all] My Newsroom Retrospective, The Good, The Bad, and the Unfinished The Newsroom ended last night. Watched the finale and obviously I felt it during the closing lines of Sam Waterson's Charlie Skinner ""We did the news well because, we just decided to"" - A call back to the episode title of the Pilot episode. The short lived emotion I felt in that scene was shrouded by the cloud that the show never was what it could have been.

As a huge fan of Aaron Sorkin's ""The West Wing"" (and as a passive viewer of ""Studio 60"") I was beyond elated to hear the news of his new HBO show about a news network. The buzz came slowly but steady as we learned of the amazing casting for the show. The first promo spot featuring Jeff Daniels amazing rant about why we ""aren't the best country in the world - but we can be"" really struck home with me. In college I was a bit of a political activist, but like most people, the more you learn about the way the world works, the more you become disheartened by anyone with a voice or ability to change it.

I was looking forward to a smart show, would slap the face of partisanship and give me an intellectually stimulating drama to the same effect that ""The West Wing"" gave me, but even better. It's on HBO, shorter seasons (means less filler and fluff) the ability to use adult language and situations when necessary. I was ready with my eyes wide open.

This is not to say my ""expectations of a follow up to 'The West Wing'"" were too high. I was simply looking for what I felt was being advertised, which is less than the show ended up being.

Within the first season the show was trying extremely hard to ""out quirk"" itself. With the show belittling itself to a campy cute romantic comedy at times. I'm no one to shy away from love stories in shows by any means, but the show diluted itself with multiple love stories before really giving us one to truly care about. It became clear it was Will-Mack and Jim-Maggie but it really felt forced on us before it even got into the character development. The show did the equivalent of what ""News Night"" was so adamantly against. They were trying to please a larger audience instead of telling the story they wanted to tell. It came out as a show that I wasn't sure if I was supposed to really believe these love stories or if the show was trying to make social commentary about the media's role in the sociopolitical landscape with the protagonists actively trying to inform their viewers of issues that effect them in a bipartisan way and the antagonists were dumbing it down for ratings and harming civil discourse because of it.

Within 2 or 3 episodes, I simply felt we were being dumbed down the way Reese Lansing would have and that Sorkin was capable of so much better than this. The Gabby Giffords episode ""I'll Try To Fix You"" ended with an amazing emotional climax and music montage, perhaps a cheap effect albiet, but it was SMART. ""Doctor pronounces people dead, not the news"" I was hopeful once again. I still will sometimes look back to the ending of that episode to remember how good it was.

It picked up in it's second season but not enough, ultimately the show was cancelled and Aaron Sorkin seemed to admit he dropped the ball on the entire series. A series finale for a show with just 25 episodes (just 3 more than the first season of 'The West Wing', and that show had 7 seasons) was strangely unemotional for me, but it the end I still *felt it* and that what I wanted the show to do. I did a few times, but simply not enough.

With a show I watch until the end I usually have two reactions, ""Oh I wish it didn't end so soon but what a ride"" or ""It was time for the show to end"" (With the latter usually being the case unfortunately) but my reaction to this show was incredibly unique, because while I understand why it ended so soon, I really wished it could have had the chance to be the show I wanted it to be, which it so carefully toyed with so many times. I imagine the emotional apex of Charlie's death and Mack taking over as President being so impactful after 5-6 seasons, but that's not how the cards fell and I have to deal with that.

The show had such an amazing ensemble cast, perhaps one of the most intellectual show runners ever, a great writing staff, a great network, it seemed to have everything, but for some reason it just never got it's chance to come together. The biggest shame is that we won't ever get a chance to see that cast again together.

I will forever remember ""The Newsroom"" for what it could and should have been rather than for what it was, but the one take away is that it will still be a show I remember rather than forgot about."

But,in the first episode he and Will have a fight about him choosing to get off a ""sinking ship"". He's also surprised that Mac is replacing him when he first meets her (In the pilot). But, in the finale, he knows that she's replacing him as EP.

Really not a big plothole, but something I stumbled upon by watching the first episode right after the finale. Either way, I loved the show and the finale."

413,"Why hating the finale might be what the writers wanted. (Spoilers)     So my friend and I got together to watch the final episode. He bought a cheap bottle of Jameson Whiskey to toast to Charley and the end of one of our favorite shows. (Yes, we are total nerds) 
   Within 15 minutes we HATED it. I felt that several flashbacks manipulated characters in a way the fit only the narrative of the finale. The most blatant was the idea that Don was always a true believer in portraying only the news. (I watched season 1 last week, mostly because I have too much time on my hands after finals) First season Don felt so much different from Finale flashback Don. I also hated the whole notion that Charley secretly wanted the staff of the newsroom to fight with him. (making it seem his heart burst from  joy) I felt that Charley was genuinely flighting to keep the staff from being fired. It seemed that Sloan and company had utterly broken the peace Charley had brokered. The flashbacks told how Charley was the puppet master behind the changes to Will's show, what I wondered was who didn't know that. I felt that the flashbacks beat us over the head on this idea.  The guitar scene was… well… Like I said before, my friend and I hated the episode.
     So after a couple of shots, our swearing began to give way to discussion. I brought up that hating the episode might be what the writers actually wanted. I just finish taking 2 semesters of Theatre History. Last semester we studied ""Three Penny Opera."" (stick with me) The play is about a rogue that keeps dodging punishment by the law and the thieves guild. (rough summary) In the end he is about to be hung, and then out of nowhere the queen comes and saves him, duex machina style. The ending is abrupt and offers little explanation. Most consider it an unsatisfactory ending to good play. The ending is so abrupt that it takes the audience out of the illusion of the play. It allows the audience to think about what they just saw rather than just continuing to watch mindlessly. 

So, do you think there is any chance that this explain why the Newsroom ending seems so unfulfilling? 

Other arguments that we came up with were: This was Sorkin's tribute to himself. The writers couldn't figure out to end it, so they went with the Wayne's World happy ending. Sorkin gave up. HBO said no to a darker ending.

We also realized that we would probably not be happy with any ending.

Among the tough to hear cadence differences, Jennifer Johnson (sorority girl) refers to herself differently each time - Jenny originally and Jenna in the finale.

And I'm probably a lot harder on it than I would be with any other show, because Aaron Sorkin, West Wing, blah blah blah.  I think it has a great message, excellent writing, and a fairly strong cast.  But the editing and direction... man oh man.  There hasn't been a single episode where I don't cringe at the sloppiness of it all.

Bad camera angles.  Rushed dialogue.  Jagged cuts.  Horrible timing and tone on segments that are supposed to be comedic (especially in scenes with Charlie or Sloane.)  I feel like all the pieces are there for this to be truly one of the best shows of the decade... if only it could have had a competent director and editor(s).  

Still sad to see it go tomorrow.  Even bad Sorkin is better than good ... pretty much anyone else.

"
444,"Another topic Sorkin touches on this season. One thing I picked up on this season is that Sorkin touches on the idea that young people will ignore the advice from the older generation and try things out themselves, without thinking of all the consequences for those involved. Whether this is strictly a Millennial thing or not, I have no idea.

We see it with Randy/Blaire where they want to strike out on their own. They don't care if 100k people lose their jobs, they want to have the experience of doing it on their own and getting in touch with their entrepreneurial side. 

Similarly, Pruitt doesn't care if he succeeds or fails with the news. He has the money, so he wants to use ACN and all the people who work there as experiments to see if his way of doing the news will work, and so that he, personally, can learn from the experience. "
445,"At this point, I just feel like ""fuck it"", and I'm not even sure I'll watch the finale. This season is too short, too compact, and it's failing to deliver. It's like watching the band Phish on a bad day: if you squint hard enough, you can almost *see* where they'd like to go, and you know it would be totally awesome if they could get there - but the reality is that they're not going to get there before the curtain comes down.

It's disappointing... I feel like this show had so much more potential that it could've lived up to. Season 1 was pretty amazing, season 2 got a bit muddy but had some fun, and season 3 had some absolutely bad-ass personalities &amp; story lines, but every single thread is getting the rip-cord treatment. Damn shame."

450,[SPOILER] Preview: The Newsroom Series Finale 
451,"Title Interpretation for S03E05 Hey all.

So I was thinking about what the title represents. The song is, of course, beautiful. 

This is what I found online.

""Shenandoah"" (also called ""Oh Shenandoah"", or ""Across the Wide Missouri"") is an American folk song, dating to the early 19th century. The lyrics may tell the story of a roving trader in love with the daughter of an Indian chief; in this interpretation, the rover tells the chief of his intent to take the girl with him far to the west, across the Missouri River. Other interpretations tell of a pioneer's nostalgia for the Shenandoah River Valley in Virginia, and a young woman who is its daughter; or of a Union soldier in the American Civil War, dreaming of his country home to the west of the Missouri river, in Shenandoah, Iowa (though the town lies some 50 miles east of the river).

It's such a heavy subject.

Yeah, i think the complete opposite of what newsroom is getting bashed for.  they didn't present a case that makes it harder for rape victims, they actually lay out a complete discussion about how awfully hard it is to deal with something like that on the backend and how there's no good way out.  what can they possibly do?  it's like the deck is stacked against them.  




---




sorry went on a tangent, but yeah, if only they could do a follow up movie (firefly did), i'd definitely think the center news story could revolve around what's happening in the US today with all the cops killing African Americans and getting off.  they're getting wrecked in public (not saying they shouldn't here, or that they should, just reality), and in a situation not involving any of these cases, if a white cop were in the right, they would have no shot publicly, just like the af-ams getting shot have no shot in the justice system right now.  AS did do a similar storyline in West Wing about a white cop and a black kid, and that was very deep.  but it was all towards a political situation and the type of convo they just had about rape.  (I do have to say, AS isn't shying away from any topic)  WW does address race a ton, multiple charlie storylines, reparations, the cop, the comedian, some of the appointed officials, etc etc.  but all political.  




---



there's tons of staff sotrylines he could use for the movie too.  maggie making the big jump if she doesn't in episode 6, jim/maggie wedding, some more neal stuff, or whatever's happening to the staff later.  the show is so good at designing the antagonist as not a person but an internal struggle reflected in different people.  ratings and entertainment vs moral journalism.  ugh... why is it ending?!? did it have to end for AS to write this season?  this season is way way way better than the other two.  



i say this wearing a hoodie over a t-shirt that says ""i can't breath"", holding my hands up saying ""hands up don't shoot"".  it's hurting and i can't think my way out of it.

I understand Charlie's situation in the latest episode, trying to keep ACN together while keeping Prewitt happy. But in all previous seasons, he's always been a straight-shooter.

He seems to have hit a lot of issues that split progressives (rape, Snowden/leaks in general) and generally I feel like over three seasons of The Newsroom you can figure out his views on most everything.

I'm just curious as to what people think his views on the issue of criticism of Islam v. Islamophobia are, or if the lack of inclusion in The Newsroom indicates that he considers it a non-issue and not worthy of the News Night 2.0 model at all."

I want to honestly know what other people who watch this show think of the scene and what they took away from it. 

I want, for the record, to state that I am a male journalist. I work for a medium sized print publication with a similar style of staff to the news room. I'd most liken myself to Don, in that it's my job to meet with people and get their story. Find out things about them.

I think there are three things that need to be discussed. 
1. Was what Don saying bad/wrong/evil? 
2. Was what Mary doing the ethically right thing to do?
3. What was the point Sorkin was trying to make?



I'll go first to get things rolling.

**Was what Don saying bad/wrong/evil?**

I think Don was playing the ""Justice System"" card, which is ultimately Sorkin's message. (I'll get to this later.) I don't think Don is wrong in what he said but he doesn't offer what I think to be a good solution. I believe he's not saying she's lying, (when she accused him of it I immediately and audibly was like no...that's not what he's saying), I believe he's saying that because of the way the law works, without further evidence, it's her word against his and we know how that all plays out. So I don't think he's a ""rape apologist"" or whatever the critics are saying.

**Is what Mary is doing the ethically right thing to do?**

Ethics are different for everyone and I hope we all think about the website and how it will effect people. 

I draw a similar correlation to the herpes alert website, because like herpes, if you're raped that's something I feel stays with a person forever. 
We all know that there are a ton of people on there who have herpes and aren't telling their partners. We also know there is a percentage of people on there that are 100% herpes free and someone wanted to harm them in that manner for that reason.

So the ethical question for us all is this: Is the damage caused to rapists worth the damage to non rapists? 

I think a lot of people will say that for every false report of rape there are 1000000000000 rapes that are not prosecuted (I'm exaggerating because I don't know the figures but I know it's a high ratio) and there are 10000000000000000 more rapes that aren't reported. 

But that's not the idea. We all agree that any amount of rape is a bad thing and any rapist should be punished. But are we willing to overlook that there will be collateral damage and those people will never get justice either? Aren't we just creating more victims that won't have justice over people that harmed them?

To me there has to be a better way. I don't know what it is, but there has to be it. The anonymous way it hypothetically would be reported to me seems a little backwords. Maybe I'm wrong but in court if you accuse someone of rape, they have the right to know who it was. Shouldn't the same apply to the accused of rape? 

**What was the point that Sorkin was trying to make?**
I think there are three reasons this story was put in. One, they needed to actually look like they're working. Two, Don needed a reason to fight against the owner. Three, Sorkin is questioning how our justice system works. 

Our law works (or doesn't depending on your point of view) by operating under the idea that everyone is innocent until a jury of your peers believes you are guilty beyond reasonable doubt. 

I personally believe ""slut shaming"" --saying the victim was wearing something, doing something or ""indicating something"" that meant the victim wanted to have sex should not be allowed as evidence. The victim either said yes or she said no. The victim was either capable of making that decision or not. When we are very clear about what we, as a society to be rape, then I think the law can be better enforced. 

Anyway, what is everyone else's thoughts on the episode and the following discussion. 

I'm curious to see what everyone says. (I also apologize for grammar mistakes and if this discussion is to much about rape and not enough about the newsroom if so Mods feel free to delete.)

476,HBO’s ‘The Newsroom’ Draws Backlash Over Rape Plot 
477,"We are witnesses the Golden Age of Television, and I am saddened that America is not ready for THE NEWSROOM. This show has the most concise, clever, thought provoking writing I have ever seen. I am not ready for it to be over. It is a tragedy that more people don't appreciate the genius in this show. Damn you Sorkin. That is all. "
478,"What Sorkin (and his characters) don't understand about ""young people"" and their relationship with the media. *""Young people know when they're being talked down to""*.  This isn't the first show I've seen this sentiment expressed on, but Sorkin's take is especially hilarious in his obtuseness because the entire foundation of The Newsroom's hero's is on faulty ground.  The show and it's characters are fighting for a dying institution/medium.  It's over. The genie can't go back into the bottle. The internet, and the ""new media"" will only grow, and it's up to the old media to figure out how to adapt, or die.

Instead of condescending to the new generation about sensationalized headlines and bite-sized tidbits, versus in-depth coverage and contrasting opinions, it might be worthwhile to actually examine what is it about the digital world today that leads to these new information consumption patterns.

Despite all romanticism to the contrary, the ""old-school"" journalism that Sorkin portrays is not without faults. Fundamentally, it is a question of depth vs breadth. The world used to move a lot slower, and access to information was a lot harder, so depth was a natural approach. News stories and scandals would dominate the conscious and subconscious debate for longer periods of time. The cost of this was missing out and ignoring deeper scandals and letting them go on behind the scenes.  Numerous big stories (The Gulf of Tonklin, the british parliamentary pedophile ring, etc) were able to stay hidden throughout history because the average citizen did not have access to a distribution network with the power of the internet. 

In today's faster moving world, the new generation demands access to more information. More voices. More stories. More breadth. It's not a short attention span issue, it's a desire to not to have the veil pulled over our eyes like the old media loves to do, and always has done.  Reporting on ""tweets"" from ""citizen journalists"" during hour 4 of a 6 hour coverage of Casey Anthony is certainly not the answer, and The Newsroom is right to criticize it, but it's just a desperate attempt from the old media to stay relevant, it's not the next evolution.  The internet, the daily beast, slate, and hell, even buzzfeed with its long form journalism, and other sites just like it is what the future looks like. In 20 years, no one outside of a senior's home is going to be sitting down to watch news on the TV during a regularly scheduled hour.  I'm not saying THIS approach isn't without flaws either, but it's inevitable, and everyone needs to figure out how to work within it, rather than pining for the good ol' days.

The show tries desperately to villify visionaries who see the writing on the wall - to present them as immature kooky billionaires full of buzzwords and no valuable ideas.  But that's simply not how things work in the real world. And before you mention The New Republic to me, there are more examples that contradict their example than those that support it.  Whether it's Jeff Bezos buying the Washington Post, or the The New York Times successfully evolving into the 21st century, we know it can be done.

So yes, young people know when they're being talked down to. They know when they are being talked down to by an aging institution (Television drama) fighting for an aging institution (Television news), and it's probably why this show is only getting 6 episodes, and why the entire internet hate-watches this show, and shakes it's head for how out of touch Sorkin has gotten."
479,"What if...??? As of right now, Aaron Sorkin's only upcoming project is his Untitled Steve Jobs project. So, what if after that comes out in 2016, Aaron Sorkin (who will, as of right now, not be doing anything else at the time) decides he wants to do something of a miniseries of The Newsroom. He writes 4 episodes worth of material, &amp; it airs in June 2017. 

Now, this could be done in 1 of 2 ways.

- Do what Olive Kitteridge did &amp; air the 1st 2 episodes back-to-back on Sunday June 4th, &amp; the 3rd &amp; 4th episodes air on Monday the 5th.

- Air it over 4 Sundays (most likely from June 4-25)

Plus, HBO would probably jump at the chance b/c if I'm not mistaken, Olivia Munn said they were still under contract b/c HBO thought Sorkin might change his mind.

I'm sure most of the cast would love to come back [Spoiler](/s ""without Sam Waterston for obvious reasons"").

I don't know about you, but I'd love to see that.

Thoughts?!?!?!?"
480,"Satisfying end? Let me start by saying that I'm a huge TV-Sorkin fan and no matter what happens in the next episodes that's not going to change.

Having said that, I have absolutely no idea what would have to happen to make the finale satisfying for me. I can't think of any outcome that would give me closure. 

I definitely can't think of a positive outcome which would make me happy. Pruit just leaving/backing down because he feels guilty seems simplistic and out of character. ACN being sold to someone else seems like a cop out and science fiction. Everybody quitting in outrage and starting their own network is too fairytale-ish (although if anyone can make that work it's Sorkin).

So what? Are just gonna keep working under Pruit without changing anything? Because there isn't enough time left to make big changes.

What end would satisfy you? What end wouldn't?

I just hope Sorkin can pull it off."
481,"Heard a familiar voice from the other room, and was like ""Why is my 4 year old niece watching The Newsroom?"" "
482,"An Unlucky Coincidence (lots of spoilers) Maybe coincidences happen a lot in this show and I haven't noticed before but in the most recent episode Charlie dies just hours before Will is released from jail. From what I can tell, the two events aren't related. Mac thought Will would be getting out of jail so it makes no sense for her to have approved Sloan's interview and risk their jobs. Charlie then dies from the stress and Will is released for totally unrelated reasons involving the source. So the fact that the death and his release from jail occurred so close together looks to be an (un)lucky coincidence aka bad writing.

I would have liked for Mac's decision to do the interview to have been caused somehow by the knowledge that Will would be released from prison but that's not what I saw. Maybe I'm missing something."
483,"[Spoilers] Blown away by that moment in last night's episode I can't believe I didn't fucking pick up on the cell mate being Will's dad until they showed his picture in the end.

I understand his arguments that you need the audience in order to even discuss the stories they want to discuss, but previously he would have never given the OK to stories like Lady Gaga and ACNgage (though sloan's destruction of that guy was epic) no matter what.  Do you think he just gave up?  Why did Charlie seem to have changed?  Would love to hear your thoughts.

Also, why at first he says he believes her and then after she challenges him he admits he doesn't. Why not just say ""I don't know."" I'm curious what could be the rationale behind this."
492,"This show is amazing because the characters are outlets for different social issues and it makes viewers more aware and raises the level of public debate. There are so many shows (good and bad) that just create drama for drama's sake but The Newsroom has drama based on real issues that we can all relate to and discuss about and that is what make it such an interesting show. And the fact that there are so many real world references makes it realistic as well.

494,"[S03E05] How would the mob justice swing in the rape case? Since Sorkin got absolutely bombarded for the episode cause of the rape and letting Don make the call to ""not find her"" in the media (av club, vox ..)

How would you think that TV segment on ACN would play out. How would the mob react?

Facts:

- the show makes it abundantly clear that the rape happened, the viewers are never asked to question that
- she admitted to drinking too much tequila and using every drug which was placed in front of her: molly, coke, shrooms
- not the police, nor the DA, nor the campus police (with preponderance of evidence) wanted to touch the case
- she puked and passed out
- she has no visible (for the viewer) bruises anywhere and doesn't mention a struggle 
- they took off her cloths so it is to be assumed that she wasn't in control of her body
- the rapists are rich
- the rapists stick to a different story, but come across as sleazy 

---

The interview on TV:

She will repeat her story. If she doesn't bring up the insane amount of drugs the other party or the interviewer will. Also her website will come up.

The rapists will be coached by media professionals (they have rich parents and money) so they will likely come across better than when they talked to Don. They are rapists, so they are morally bankrupt and will lie. Based on that their story will be something like that:

We found her in the bathroom. She looked fine to us, but since she puked we offered to bring her into a bedroom to rest for a bit. While walking there we asked her why she puked and she told us that she just had one drink and doesn't know. She was very lively and showed us she is sober by pretending we were officers trying to arrest her. She walked a straight line and touched her nose with her fingers - you know the usual. She was outgoing and fun, we had no idea that she was full of drugs. In the room she not only gave enthusiastic consent, she literally begged us to fuck her and bring more people in. She said she never had a threesome before and wanted to cross that off her college list.

She says she wants a win. But I honestly can't see how she would get one unless the rapists mess up big time."

504,The Newsroom Season 3: Episode #6 Preview (HBO) 
505,"Finale Theory: The kid(s) at the end of Camelot. It really feels to me like Mac &amp; Charlie's vision for ACN dies with Charlie and the final episode sees the gang split up and go out into the world. As ACN has crumbled we've seen Maggie become more confident, capable and assertive throughout this season. She weathered the storm last season and is now on the level of Don, Jim and Sloan. In fact we've seen them all do morally courageous things this season.

With that in mind, I offer the theory that the junior staff are ALL the ""kid at the end of Camelot"" Will references at the end of season one. 

Wherever they go to out into the world once ACN rebrands or self-destructs during the course of the finale, they carry on the institutions ACN instilled in them, ultimately influencing future generations on how to do the news based on the teachings of Charlie, Will and Mac. Because they have lived through and been there for ""News Night 2.0"" and the mock debate and everything else, they are the ones most qualified to ""tell people that it's possible."" 

The legacy of Charlie and even Will and Mac ultimately lives on in Maggie, Jim, Don, Sloan and everyone else. As Will rides off into the sunset he can reflect on a job well done that there was not just one ""kid at the end of Camelot"" but a whole staff full of them.

Will does a final broadcast dedicated to Charlie. 

Sloan and Don bring him up to speed on everything that has transpired in the days he's been away. He meets with the Lansings at the funeral who agree to assist him (Either with inside info for the cause or using the time to find a way to distract Pruit whilst Newsnight run the final broadcast). In the same vein that he apologised for the way ACN had been going up until Mac got there, he addresses the new direction Newsnight has taken under new ownership, calls out the negligence of citizen journalism, public invasion, biased speculations from those unqualified etc etc. Full broadcast in a blaze of glory that gets them all fired, like Jesus in the temple with the merchants. I don't think they're ever going to 'Win One' until they're willing to give up everything, which they weren't willing to do with Genoa and giving up the Source. The new ACN is not what Leona and Charlie built, it's not what the news team built and I think it's safe to assume that the staff are dedicated to Will enough to go down with the ship if he called it quits. 

Bonus would be if another Newscorp would take on their show at the very end, but I think it would end with them turning the lights off and leave us to imagine their fates.

I hope at least...."
512,Interesting thoughts on the negative side of this season 
513,"Sorkin's obsession with what college people went to Another episode that brings up where people went to school.  I just don't get it.  And frankly, it feels elitist to a level that's not even accurate.  I went to a very old, very good school myself and I can tell you I don't bring it up all the time nor hang it over people's head.  And neither do the people I went to that school with.  I have no idea why he thinks the school people went to is so important to professionals when its half a lifetime ago.  The working world quickly teaches you to flush any collegiate pomp down the toilette and gain some real world skills and experience.  So nothing is more useless and shitty than someone who hangs their hat on what college they went to, especially if they are middle-aged.

And furthermore Sorkin continues to give this uber alles revelry to ivy league/British colleges.  You can get a comparable education at any number of state colleges like UC Berkeley, UVA, Michigan, the military academies; and their admission process doesn't factor in a bunch of legacy/donor under-the-table bullshit.  But still, in his shows someone has to go to a top university by old money standards and as soon as someone namedrops, the discussion goes cold as the other party submits in some ridiculous subordination to a name.

To put in perspective his over-emphasis on educational accolades over substance or reality, I began reading up on the big time anchors of today to see if they had such achievements.  Brian Williams didn't even finish college.  George Stephanopolous has a similar background to Will McAvoy but actually got his masters in theology as opposed to cliche law degree.  David Muir - bachelors degree from Ithaca College.  Scott Pelley - Texas Tech.  Wolf Blizter - University of Buffalo followed by Johns Hopkins.  So you get the picture.  Not only its Sorkin's obsession with the ivy league and where people went to school weird, its certainly not representative of where the upper echelon in the journalism field attended.  And I certainly didn't know where any of these anchors went to school nor does it now at all temper my opinion on their efficacy.  "

I can longer overlook the constant inconsistencies in this show. We were copped out, and that was shit writing.

522,"A quick interpretation of tonight's big events [SPOILERS AHEAD] You've been warned.

So Charlie died. As devastating as it was, it's probably the most symbolic way he could have died. 

Charlie represents old school reporting from the days of Woodward and Bernstein, where immediacy wasn't quite superiority (being fast helped, but getting it right was the focus.) Then Pruett shows up. He's a millennial kid who thinks citizen journalism, reporting on celebrities and essentially cutting out fact-checking and other hallmarks of journalism will save it. 

When Charlie spends the entire episode telling his reporters to go along with it, he's taking on the role of the journalism industry. The changes he endured were such a shock that it ended his life, and Sorkin thinks current new journalism trends will kill off the industry that stands for reporting on the most important stories instead of celebrity bullshit.

I'm really sad to see him go and this episode's events certainly paint him as a tragic figure. But I'm struggling to find a better way to kill him off. It's one of the hits in this episode filled with either really strong writing (Don and the rape victim) and poorly-written work (Jim and Maggie.)

EDIT: how do names work?"
523,"[Spoiler] A word about Aaron Sorkin Ok, let me start off by saying that Aaron Sorkin is my favourite writer for both TV and Film. In my opinion, the greatest words in the english language are ""Written By Aaron Sorkin"". However... He does have an air of predictability when it comes to certain things, the main one being evidenced in last nights episode.

If I where an actor being cast in an Aaron Sorkin series over the age of 50 and a friend/confidante to the main character, I wouldn't bother unpacking! So far, I cannot think of a single series where an older and usually wiser character hasn't at the very least had a life threatening medical problem, and at the worst, died!

In Sports Night, possibly the only excusable example of the bunch, they gave Isaac Jaffe a stroke that caused him to be absent for the second half of the first series and a distinct change in his outlook on life in the second season. I say this is excusable, as the only reason this was necessary was the actor who played him, the ever-talented Robert Guillaume, had a severe stroke midway through filming...

Next, we come to loveable Leo McGarry, President Bartlett's CoS and his best friend. Not only did working give this guy a heart attack and fire him, he then killed him off! Again, the death was only a part of the season due to John Spencers death in real life, but surely for a writer with the talents of Sorkin there could have been a work around that didn't involve me still sobbing uncontrollably when I watch this episode even to this day. (21 year old Male by the way).

And as if killing off the chief of staff wasn't enough, he had already taken the pen and ink to kill off my favourite minor character Sorkin has ever constructed, Mrs Landingham! I know that it was necessary motivation for the MS thing as well as running for office, but at the time I remember it just seeming senseless.

Then we come to the most throwaway health issue out of the four of them, firing Wes Mendel on day one of the series, and then six months later giving him a heart attack 6 years ago! We never particularly got to see his character in play, although it was quite clear that he was an important part of the lives of all of the main characters!

And finally, last night. Charlie Skinner was one of my favourite characters Sorkin had ever written. Funny, dry wit, old establishment with a compassion and lovability that shone through in some of the best character development I have ever seen in a series. And to see him almost make it to the final episode and die 60 minutes away from a happy life of being written and theorised about in the inevitable outpouring of ""what would they be doing now"" fan fiction is just heartbreaking. In some ways, sorkin is almost as impactful as a tragedy writer as he is a drama writer.

I love Aaron Sorkin's work, and if the tv websites are right and this is the end of the road for his TV writing career, I am glad to have been around for this."

Also obvious, Josh and Donna - Jim and Maggie.

Will got a name from Neal, but he thought the source was a male. He was sincere about going to jail to protect the source, but when Mac told him what she knew about Lily, he realized that means either his name is a fake or Lily is a fake. I'm going with his name (given to him by Neal, for purposes unknown) is fake. He realized this just before going into the grand jury.

He knows that Mackenzie knows the source personally, so now the only way he can expose the source is by pointing them to Mac. So he married her. Now, he (potentially, by the rules of TV) can't be compelled to incriminate her.

So he now has a legal basis to keep the source secret.

""You feel responsible for a lot of things."" says Neal, cottoning on.

579,"Well, I think I ruined the finale for myself. [Spoiler] Well with the addition of Paul Lieberstein and B.J. Novak, I was interested in seeing if there was any more office guest stars, specifically ones who used to be producers/writers of the office.

My first instinct was to look on IMDB at the future episodes to see if I could spot any names. Huge mistake, because I came across this link.  

[This link contains indirect spoilers.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3680822/?ref_=tt_ep_nx)

So, on that page you can see there are mourners as names of some of the actors.  Well shit, someone is going to die in the last episode or episode before.

Then I see something that leads me to believe, the person I don't want to die, is going to die. The character the actress Audrey Rose is playing is ""Charlie's Daughter.""  

In the last episode, Charlie mentioned he spoke to his daughter.  This is the only thing that makes me hope, it could be Charlie's ex-wife that dies, but I personally believe it will be Charlie.

Any other evidence for it being Charlie who dies? Well I searched on google before I finally determined it was Charlie that would die and found this.

[Last Episode Synopsis](http://www.hypable.com/2014/11/19/the-newsroom-series-finale-synopsis-the-question-is-who/)

They mention the synopsis and it states that a death will effect Will and Mac.  It also mentions Neal, Leona, Pruit and Maggie are doing something, so they probably won't die.  They put up Charlie as their first guess too and while I don't agree that he will the one of the least heartbreaking, I agree with their prediction.

Fuck this, Charlie is my favorite. I'm an idiot.

"
580,"How The Newsroom Ends (Spoiler Alert!) Jim and Hallie sit in silence in a booth at Hang Chew's. On a television above them, Sloan's show is on, and she is reporting that someone has bought Continental Corp for some ridiculous sum. At the same time, a stock graph for NYSE: SIA appears showing a marked increase in share price. Jim admits he was a dick and apologizes to Hallie, but then starts to recant when he gets a push notification from his phone w/ her article -- a takedown piece on the still-a-fugitive Neal and the leaked government documents. It gets 1.6 millions page views. Hallie tells Jim thanks for everything, but she's got her prize piece and a book deal now. After taking a moment to reassure Jim that he was adequate in bed, Hallie get up and walks off. 

Jim slumps in his seat, devastated, as a mysterious stranger sitting in the booth behind him turns to him and says ""Your friend is going to be fine."" Jim asks how the stranger knows, to which he replies ""I just know. I always just know"", and gets up to leave. A beat later, and another push notification on Jim's phone. ACN reports that the source has come clean and has taken full responsibility. Jim turns around looking puzzled -- who was that mysterious man?

Cut to AWM boardroom. Just as Lucas Pruit's bid for AWM is about to go through, Calvin Trager walks into the board room to announce that Quo Vadimus has just completed a hostile takeover of Savannah Capital and is buying AWM after all, paying off the Lansing Twins for a full $1/share over what Pruitt offered. He gruffly announces that ""Anyone who can't make money off of News Night should get out of the money making business."" and then pointedly stares at the camera for about 10 seconds in silence. Blair looks bitchy and hot and says something about not caring as long as she gets hers before passionately kissing Pruit. Leona and Charlie are so elated that they initiate crazy old drunk sex on the boardroom carpet (off-camera) while Will and Mackenzie have a staring contest that may never end. Don rushes in, tripping over the old fornicators with Sloan walking right in behind him. They say that they don't care what happens to their jobs, but they need to get married right away. Randy happens to be an ordained minister (from the Internet, but who cares) and notary, so Sloan and Don have a quickie wedding followed by a high five and also begin rolling around the boardroom floor in orgiastic glee. Jim and Maggie walk into the room and look at each other, shrug their shoulders in resignation and drop to the floor as well. Rebecca Halliday just stands over all of them observing the scene, looking smoky. Newly-exonerated Neal walks into the room, tripping over Don and Sloan, and cluelessly says ""What did I miss?"" Everyone immediately stops to hug him. Will, Jim, and Don decide to carry Neal into the Newsroom, Rudy-style. 

We follow our gang through the newsroom, where everyone stands and cheers. Red news alerts are going off like crazy and Eliot is on the air trying to give a report about Mohammed Morsi, but no one gives a shit. Charlie throws Gary Cooper a key and tells him to open the bottom drawer on the right side of his desk. Gary says ""I thought that thing was broken"" when he unlocks it and finds rolls of old ticker tape.  Charlie yells from across the room ""I've been saving it for a special occasion!"" and suddenly ticker tape is flying around the newsroom. Intern Jenna drops a tray of coffee. 

Trager walks into an elevator and observes the pandemonium with a calm look on his face as the doors close. 

Trager stands on the roof of the AWM building, looking out for the Bus, which lands just in time. The hatch opens and we see a cane, followed by feet. Nick Fury walks out onto the roof and looks around, announcing ""mmm mmm! I just love it when white people have a happy ending!"" Staring out into the New York skyline, we see the nearly-finished Freedom Tower where the CSC letters are being replaced by a logo for Stark International.

591,"Whats with the hate this show gets? I binge watched this show over the past week and I think its great. I have some qualms with certain parts of the show. I think its lacking in character diversity. I think the story is sometimes just silly with the amount and magnitude of mistakes made. I think the romance story lines are questionable. But overall its clearly a quality show with amazing dialogue, and is an entertaining, intellectually stimulating watch. There's some excellent and topical political commentary as well.

But I came on reddit to see what people thought and the criticism has been atrocious. Ive seen complaints that the dialogue is not realistic. Really? The dialogue on a television show being ""unrealistic"" is a legitimate criticism? Ive seen people complain that the female characters are poorly constructed and stupid. Aside from Maggie, I have liked the female characters on the show more than almost any other show. They aren't shown as being beneath men, or less intelligent than men in any way. I feel like there is real equality in terms of the importance, intellect, and input of the female characters. 

Does the show get soap boxy? Well yeah, and that's a legitimate complaint, but I didn't find it nearly as pretentious as the majority of people seem to.

Do you guys think the hate the show gets is justified? Am I glossing over some of the real problems of the show with rose-tinted lenses? "
592,"Nebraska vs. Texas A&amp;M I know it was just a minor part of the dialogue in the meeting between Will and the gang and the FBI, but Texas A&amp;M and Nebraska have never played each other 4 years in a row, let alone 4 straight A&amp;M losses in 4 consecutive years. The writers could've probably picked a different school and maintained factual accuracy.

From the looks of the promo, ACN will air the FBI search and tell the world that the offices of a network TV news station are being ransacked by government agents, looking for the identity of a confidential source. 

This has never happened in the U.S. before, so it will be major news, it will dominate not just the news, but also political discussions.

This will cause ACN’s ratings to go through the roof.

Consequently, ACN stock will also skyrocket. In fact, the stock price will get so high, that the investment firm that was going to buy the shares from the twins, backs out. They say that the shares are just too expensive, and it’s not worth the cost.

628,"This is the Bloomberg Terminal which costs $24,000 a year for a single terminal subscription "
629,"[Spoilers] Neal's legal situation post Boston Season 3 Episode 1 regarding Neals legal problem...

Neal is being set up.
Season 2 Episode 5, Charlie has a meeting with his 'source'.
Charlie calls him 'Shep' in their meeting, and we learn that he is a 'spy' that works for ONI, the Office of Naval Intelligence.
Shep gives charlie the document that we come to know as the helicopter manifest in the Genoa story, which supposedly has reference to the sarin gas, but is really a secret personal note to Charlie that says ""fuck you"".

In the conclusion of the Genoa story, Red team III, Charlie goes to meet Shep in a parking garage. Shep reveals that he set Charlie up with the manifest because he blames Charlie for the death of his son. The only other person Shep mentions by name in that conversation is Neal. He blames Neal and Charlie equally for his sons suicide because Neal fired David (Shep's son). He also states he is confused by the medias fascination with the number 3, ""3 days 3 months 3 years""

The email message Neal gets tells him to up his encryption to be able to handle 3 trillion (tri=3) guesses per second. He receives about 27,000 documents (30x30x30, or 30^3=27,000). 27000 divided by 90 days (the total number of days David worked for ACN)=300 documents a day. (lots of 3's)

It would make sense that the situation Neal finds himself in now, with the stolen documents, has been set up by Shep to lure him into doing something illegal, which he can then be arrested for. It's entrapment if the Newsroom can prove it, but right now it looks like they haven't figured out what is going on. 

BTW the USB key that Neal gets was hidden in a toilet in a steak house in NYC. This is obviously a Godfather reference. Michael Corleone gets a gun from a toilet and then is forced into hiding in Italy for several years after the killing. Neal enters the bathroom, and there is a man at the sink. When the man looks over at Neal he smiles, then looks down, wipes his hands, and leaves the bathroom.
The man in the bathroom is the one who left the USB key.

The Newsroom need to realize, and then find a way to prove that Shep leaked the documents. 
They really have no choice but to do it on their own. They could go to the FBI, but there is a risk that ONI has people there too. Although they may cooperate with some federal agency to smoke out the leek. Im not sure which direction they will go.
So Neals current storyline is sort of a continuation of the Genoa storyline.

If the team can root out Shep as the leak, they could then go public with the fact that they were set up on Genoa from the beginning over a personal grievance. This would restore their credibility, and renew their reputation with the government sources they currently have but are unable to use because of Genoa.

At the end of season 3 episode 1, Neal describes the secret documents he received. He says BCD is a contractor for SOCOM that places stories in foreign press about US soldiers doing community outreach in addition propaganda to help our foreign policy. This happens to be exactly what Maggie ended up doing in Africa, though she never completes that story as far as we know.

So it is also possible that Shep is the one that OK's Maggie's trip to Africa, knowing she was being sent in to a dangerous area, maybe even intentionally trying to get her and Gary killed, though I am not sure why at this point, other than to continue to fuck with Charlie.

"
630,I could not stop laughing at this little moment. I think it's the way Charlie's standing on one leg. 
631,"[Spoiler](/s ""Damnit, I think I understand ""The Newsroom"", the way Sorkin wanted to portray it. Read if you want spoilers"") I think The Newsroom was supposed to be about a character exploration of Will McAvoy and we took it to be an idealistic statement about the way a Newsroom ought to be run. 

Think about it, the whole series thus far we've been getting crippling insights about Will McAvoys character, and his innermost frailty and the best we got from everyone else is a supporting evidence or comedic relief. 

I think Sorkin wanted to explore a frail old-middle aged man who is Highly Intelligent and has the ego of someone who is Highly Intelligent (Intellectual pissing contests are a constant) takes up the beliefs of those around him just to be liked by them. And when he inevitably gets bit in the ass he is unable to take it, because he never believed truly in them, and he takes it as an attack on his character, and not his ideas. 


* Why he couldn't handle it when Mac Cheated on him.
* He's a Republican because he's a Nebraskan. And not because he espouses the ideas of the Party in it's current state.
* He takes it personally to oversee the well being of his staff even though he has no obligation to --&gt; circling back to protecting his siblings from his drunk dad (the therapist laid this out for us)
* He's in a Newsroom with Idealists who have defined what ""good"" new's is, and now that he has Mac back he's questioning if he agree's with what is ""good"" is (Ep 1 of Season 3 is basically this in the beginning)
* He's fighting with everyone to prove how smart he is rather than showing he gets the idea that everyone is talking about. And the sad inherent thing is he's friggin intelligent (saw the whole FBI thing coming a mile away, and while he's in the room he's fighting with the lawyer to prove he's a better lawyer --&gt; when in reality he told Neil to call her rather than personally representing Neil, because the foresaw there was going to be a time when he's going to need to shelter Neil from the consequences and he can't do that as his lawyer)

What Sorkin is doing this Season is burning down the amazing context he placed Will McAvoy (AKA his Newsroom and the amazing people in it), until all we have left is just a beaten down Will in the corner. And it's going to become brutally obvious that The Newsroom is about Will McAvoy and not his ideas. 

* The trailer when Charlie said he's doing all of this for Mac. (showing he doesn't have the same idealistic belief as everyone else)
* Charlie is a father figure he never had and he constantly craves his opinion. 
* The Don Quijote metaphor. We took it as everyone who was in The Newsroom is Don Quijote for being outlaw News figures. But Will still thinks he alone is Don Quijote. "

639,"Relevance of the twins' birthday (S03E01 spoilers) So the relevance of the twins birthday is that it isn't until they are 25 that they get control of their stock and are then able to sell it.

Right now someone else is buying up the stock - it was noted early in the episode that the twins have zero interest in a news network. Once the twins hit 25 they can sell their stock (and given their obvious disinterest, their obviously shitty relationship with their brother, and the fact they would make millions, why wouldn't they?) and whoever is trying to take over the company will then have enough stock to do so."

641,"It is REESE Lansing. Also, character discussion. His named is spelled Reese, not any other of these ways y'all are throwing out.  This is the official spelling.  (Well, official according to the Wikipedia page for The Newsroom)

Let's talk about his character for a minute, though.

First of all I'm gonna be a bit biased because I love Chris Messina and I think he's devastatingly sexy.  However, I've always thought Reese was a great character.  They've used him previously as an antagonist- being one of the ""suits"", but in reality he's a guy trying to do his job the same way that the team at ACN is doing theirs.

I can tell by this season that they're really going to be humanizing him though and making him look more and more like a protagonist.

What do you think?"
642,Charlie Skinner Character Discussion So I generally think this is one of the best shows on TV but one thing has always bothered me. I've never like Sam Waterson as Charlie. Charlie is supposed to be brilliant and respected by Will but I've never viewed his as that impressive of a character. Does anyone else feel the same way?
643,"ACN and Bloomberg Terminal I just watched the episode and it was effing amazing.

However, I have to just ask...did it really take this long for Sloan to get Bloomberg Terminal? She is a finance and economic analyst for one of the best cable news network in the US, and she only got Bloomberg Terminal now? Wait what..?"
644,What do you think Sloan saw in her financial computer that alerted her about the possible takeover? 
645,"Sorkin speaking to us through Will in s3e01 So I caught onto a subtle theme running through the first episode (I know, just one?) and I wanted to air it out here, see if it sticks.

First, I want to reference [this post from /r/thewestwing,](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/2lv58x/filling_the_gap/) which talks about Sorkins motivations for writing the series *Studio 60*, and how he used his personal life to influence the story. It's a good read.

Anyway, there are a few lines in the show that caught my attention. First is in the first few minutes of the show, after Will fails to deliver a rousing speech. Talking to Charlie, Will says ""Why wasn't I able to put my finger on what we're talking about""? ""Because it's obvious"" replies Charlie.

Later, when speaking to Mac about keeping current with the other networks, Will says ""I'm still trying to figure out what doing well means"". Mac replies ""you know what it means"".

I think that Sorkin is lamenting on the current state of this show, and the defeatist attitude he has towards his latest attempt at high-brow television. It's clear that he loves this show, and that he took the negative reviews personally enough to kill the show in only 6 episodes. He know's what good television looks like, and he knows that this show is it. But he doesn't understand why nobody else can see that.

What do you guys think?"
646,"[Mildly unrelated] We have 8.7k viewers in this subreddit, how many are actually journalists? Don't know that this has been asked before but it's an interesting question. As a journalist, I'm surprised more of my colleagues don't watch it. "

* Neil leaks the documents, or the connection to the documents gets leaked somehow, and flees the country a'la Snowden

* The Hostile takeover is actually a ploy orchestrated by Will and Charlie in a partnership with some other financial backer. What better way to end on a high note then to let Will and Charlie ride off in control of their own future.

* Maggie finds a career resurgence as lead anchor at Will and Charlie's newly formed network

* Sloan takes over for the star anchor role that Will leave vacant, Dom takes over for Mac, which continues the cycle that Will and Mac had

* Reddit gets slammed again for the New Jersey shooter ordeal in making his brother public enemy number 1, not a main storyline through.

* Syria, plays a role in at least one episode

* Ebola, plays a role in at least episode

* Malaysia Flight 370 will be an episode

* Crimea/Ukraine and the Malaysia Flight 17 that was shot down will be an episode

649,"How many on here watched Sports Night? Of course the West Wing geek in me noticed the presence of Equatorial Kundu in the documents, but I also noticed a parallel to Sports Night, Sorkin's first TV show.

The staff of the show don't know what's going to happen to their careers, and they don't know what will happen to their company.

To-morrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,

The higher he 's a-getting,

The sooner will his race be run,

And nearer he's to setting.

That age is best which is the first,

When youth and blood are warmer;

But being spent, the worse, and worst

Times still succeed the former.

You may forever tarry."

I have been a Sorkin fan ever since watching The West Wing(at least 3 times now by my count) and for whatever reason i put off watching this till now, but i'm **very** happy that i finally did. This has all of the same character development and witty, fast paced dialogue i came to love in TWW. 


I guess i don't really have a point to this post other than to wait for season 3 like the rest of you, though i am wondering if there is anything that has happened since the end of S2 that i can read or watch to help with my withdrawals, i am about to go read through all of the episode discussions as well.

786,"Does anyone else hate Maggie's character? [Discussion / Spoilers throughout] I understand its part of the writing, and other than this, I love the series- Easily my most favorite tv show. But I just can't like the character Maggie has become by the end of season 2. For example, in the final episode, she gets the quote from Taylor, then gets all smug to Jim when he says he didn't find it. She didn't either! It was given to her by Taylor! Its small stuff like that. And the fact that she's turned into a slut after returning from Africa.

I currently belong to a lot of different show subreddits (mainly /r/BreakingBad, /r/SonsofAnarchy, /r/Lost, /r/Madmen, and /r/TWD), and I have to admit that this one is at times my least favorite to post to. In my opinion, what truly makes show subreddits great is the discussion that revolves around the show. What worked, what didn't, what we liked, and what we didn't. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be the same here.

It seems that in order to be heard on this subreddit, you must truly love the show and never say anything bad about it. This has become very obvious during the last few episodes, as those who post anything critical about the show are downvoted into obscurity and rarely acknowledged by one or two individuals who truly seem interested in discussing the merits of the show. 

We as a community have a chance to shape this place. Would we rather discuss the show that we all enjoy despite all of its faults, or would we rather just talk about how awesome it is and how infallible Sorkin and the cast are? It is our choice.

I will no doubt catch some flak and be seen as just some bleeding heart who wants everyone to get along, blah blah blah he just wants karma, etc. The truth is, I would just rather come to this subreddit for honest discussion and critique rather than mindless ""OMG SLOANE AND DON 4EVER!"" posts. The downvote is used here as a way to show that you disagree with someone rather than an actual post, and that only hurts the overall discussion and by extension the subreddit as a whole. I could care less about my karma, I care about the product that comes from this subreddit.

Just something to think about. It's a long time until season 3, and if this subpar content continues until then, this subreddit likely won't make it. "

851,"Will on being a Republican. [Spoilers S2E9] In a previous episode, Will says he only seems liberal because he believes that hurricanes are caused by barometric pressure and not gay marriage.  A good one-liner, but obviously not nearly enough to satisfy many critics of the show whining about Sorkin's liberal bias.

Finally, in the season 2 finale, Will expands on this a lot more after asking Taylor to take him apart.  I thought his monologue in this episode had a lot more substance and less ""zing"" than past references to his political stance.  And in the same scene, he's defending not only his own beliefs, but also ACN's strategy in covering the news, and by proxy, the so-called ""liberal media"".

Do I think it will shut the critics up?  Of course not, but I do finally feel that this subject got the treatment it deserves on the show.  After the Genoa saga, it was good to see the show getting back to what it's supposed to be all about, covering the news with a bias toward facts rather than fairness, and journalism over ratings (which we saw again when they chose not to run the Petraeus story)."

I'm from Nebraska so it is cool to know that Will McAvoy is from the same state as me and in Election Night Pt II he says a petition for his and Charlie's termination received 20,000 signatures, 6 and a half times the size of his hometown. So I did some Math and that means his hometown is roughly 3,100 people. Plus, using a quote he said in the first season, ""I'm from a town outside of a town outside of Lincoln."" which means he is from southeast Nebraska and the only towns in southeast Nebraska are Waverly (3,300), Auburn (3,500), and Central City (3,000).

When it started I hated it, having loved the Westwing the smugness was unbearable and the characters just didn't gel. Something has changed that makes this series a lot better. The relationships are a bit less adolescent though that still needs work. People are beginning to fit the characters better and the darker tone, with fallible, less smugly omniscient and preachy characters is working much better. There are still elements that aren't working, Sloane the character just doesn't work with Olivia Munn, Mackenzie is a pretty boring character and not using Emily Mortimer's talents very well. Still... progress.

The first tidbit comes from S01E08, when MacKenzie suggests what might be behind the NSA whistleblower talking to Charlie:

&gt;And another [possibility] is that someone's trying to discredit us by having Will get Dan Rather-ed.

""Dan Rather-ed"" is, of course, a reference to [a real-life Genoa-like situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy).

The second tidbit is from S01E10. Leona suggests to Will that she won't fire him, but adds:

1. Solomon Handcock. This will probably be part of season 3 if they report on Edward Snowden.

2. Trolls and death threats. Are the threats real? Will the people responsible caught? Again, they could connect this with Anonymous in season 3.

3. TMI and Reese. Did they shut down TMI? Did Reese donate any money to a school? I would be fun to see TMI go online only, ala ""Newsweek"", after it's disclosed to Leona that the print version has been losing money for months.

4. Jennifer Johnson. What happened to her after the incident at North Western? Did she have to sign anything to prevent her from suing Will or AWM before she could be an intern? It wouldn't have been a big issue but lawyers don't like loose ends.

5. Did Gary ever take protection money when he worked at TMI? Did he ever witness it directly or was it just office gossip? Not that I want another lawsuit story but it would be interesting to see his character get into trouble for his past indiscretions.

Just a few and all I can think of right now. I've added my own ideas about TMI, North Western and Gary. Add more plot points that are missing endings, make up your own based on season 1 or tell me how I'm wrong and/or an idiot. Either way, post below."

914,Climax Time: Dan Rather Recaps The Newsroom 
915,"The origin of the name ""Red Team"" - odd Sorkin mistake I guess I've gotten used to Sorkin being pretty good at his own fact checking. Sure he makes mistakes but this one is really bizarre. 

I'll caveat by saying that I'm not a journalist, but I feel pretty confident on this.

In ""Red Team III"" (S02E07) the origin of the term ""Red Team"" is explained as representing ""the red blood cells that clean up after white blood cells do their work""

At which point my head exploded, because it's such an incredibly contrived idea. 

Anyone who's been anywhere even *close* to the military can tell you that a ""red team"" is when you get your own people to represent the enemy to test your own tactics. It's from the Cold War, when the only opponent we had were the Soviets. The term is so pervasive through three decades of military strategy that *I* am aware of that at no point did it enter my mind this season that ""Red Team"" meant anything but ""we set up an opposition team of our own people to attack our story""

Hrm. 

When I was writing this, I was going to comment that if the opfor concept started today, they'd probably represent China and be called a ""Yellow Team"" except that's not PC, so they'd probably call them something else. 

Now I'm wondering if Sorkin knew the military called them ""Red Teams"" but not the origin, so he contacted a military guy to ask the question. And then I surmised that, in light of modern PCism, maybe the *military* gives this explanation of the origin of the term nowadays to avoid saying that our opposition forces are still named after the Soviets. 

Still seems kinda odd that Sorkin didn't just know the origin of the term, though. 

Sorry for the meandering - thinking this through as I type. Just not used to massive screaming errors like that in Sorkin's work. "

Anyone else agree with me?"
919,"Now that the Genoa plot has culminated, how will the rest of the show play out? During this whole second season I've been yearning for a show more like what we saw during season one. 

I think the conditions are perfect for this change. We've been on a hiatus from doing real news and breaking stories, and the ACN crew has to win back the audience's trust. The show will return to doing what it was meant to do, and the characters can stop being exhausted, worried, and anxious (a la Maggie, Jim, Charlie).

I think this Genoa plot was a great idea. It really brought in the characters to have us learn what they are like and how they act; something we wouldn't get from the former style of the show. 

I also think that Genoa was strategically placed in an dry area of news. If I'm correct, the date of the show currently is September 2012. Edward Snowden's NSA leak happens in late 2012.

What do you think about these ideas?"
920,"Does anyone know what Jerry's actually suing for? ""Institutional failure"" is not a cause of action.

921,"Thaddeus McCotter's Resignation Statement Don Keefer quoted in his depo speech last night: “Today I have resigned from the office of United States Representative for Michigan’s 11th Congressional District.

After nearly 26 years in elected office, this past nightmarish month and a half have, for the first time, severed the necessary harmony between the needs of my constituency and of my family. As this harmony is required to serve, its absence requires I leave.

The recent event’s totality of calumnies, indignities and deceits have weighed most heavily upon my family. Thus, acutely aware one cannot rebuild their hearth of home amongst the ruins of their U.S. House office, for the sake of my loved ones I must “strike another match, go start anew” by embracing the promotion back from public servant to sovereign citizen.

I do not leave for an existing job and face diminishing prospects (and am both unwilling and ill-suited to lobby), my priorities are twofold: find gainful employment to help provide for my family; and continue to assist, in any way they see fit, the Michigan Attorney General’s earnest and thorough investigation, which I requested, into the 2012 petition filing.

While our family takes this step into the rest of our lives, we do so with the ultimate confidence in our country’s future. True, as at other times in the life of our nation, we live in an Age of Extremes that prizes intensity over sanity; rhetoric over reality; and destruction over creation. But this too shall pass, thanks to the infinite, inspired wisdom of the sovereign people who, with God’s continued blessings, will again affirm for the generations American Exceptionalism.

Truly, it is a challenging and fortunate time to live in our blessed sanctuary of liberty.

In closing, to The People of Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, I can but say this: Thank you for the privilege of having worked for you.”

He was on Jabber, a chat program, with his in game friends when they were attacked:

Sean Smith spent his spare time as a diplomat for one of the largest Alliances in the game.  A perfect fit for a US State Dept. employee.

""March 2nd, 1955. A young black woman is arrested for refusing  to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Alabama. Civil Rights leaders in the ACLU rush to her side. And she will be a symbol of the struggle against segregation. Her name is Claudette Colvin and she is 15 years old. She's also unmarried and pregnant. Civil rights leaders in the ACLU decide that Colvin is not the best foot forward and stand-down. 8 months later Rosa Parks happens, but during that 8 months a brilliant and charismatic young minister gets the attention of the community and is chosen to lead the bus boycotts. If Claudette Colvin doesn't get pregnant, if they'd gone in the spring instead of 8 months later, Martin Luther King is a preacher you've never heard of in Montgomery. """

At worst, they were trying to get help for people who were injured.

And did anyone else feel like the most recent episode tried too hard to cover too many things, half of which didn't need to be done anyway? Will's dad dying was fine, and I get that they wanted to make a point about him caring more for fans than his father... but he was an abusive father, I think it was safe to assume that. Jim and Maggie's discussions seemed circular, and unproductive, (both to the story and for the characters) it didn't need to last most of the episode just to make the point that she was unhinged. Why was Dom hiding from the camera like it as going to kill him? And the guy coming out was kind of a... non event.
