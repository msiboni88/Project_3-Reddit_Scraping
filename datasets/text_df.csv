This is it, folks! It’s been a quick six months, hasn’t it? 

I want to thank everybody who participated in these rewatch threads; as quiet as this sub may be, it’s been so neat to finally have the kind of quality discussions on this show that I’ve been looking for. So thank you, and let’s do this again sometime.",0
1,Just started watching it and have a few questions. I'm a huge Sorkin fan and recently picked up this show to watch. So far I'm loving Jeff Daniels but I'm having some issues with the Maggie and a little bit with the Mac character. I dunno if it's a Sorkin thing but I can't really stand either of them when they're on the screen. They just seem so spazzy all the time. Is that going to change? I literally had to turn off the show during episode 3 (I think) because it was border like obnoxious.,0

This is a two-part HBO documentary series about the history of Rolling Stone Magazine. Jeff Daniels is the voice of the articles when they are read in the series (with the exception of Hunter S. Thompson's articles which are read by Johnny Depp).

Anyway, as a Newsroom fan I kinda like it because it sort of feels like it's Will McAvoy reading it. I'm sure Daniels is channeling a bit of the character in it. I suggest y'all check it out. I'm sure you can find it on HBO Go. I'm Canadian so I watch it on CraveTV.",0

29,"[SPOILER] Everything wrong with the Operation: Genoa story arc. SPOILER: So the gist of the entire second season of the Newsroom was like this: The entire news team went on air with a damning story about an alleged war crime committed by the US government, but without actually confirming anything in the evidence. They based their entire investigation on assumption and secondhand information. And the  plot twists that exposed the lie and brought the story and characters down were contrived and thrown in out of nowhere. The soldier having a TBI, The mission manifest having secret ink on the paper because a vindictive guy (who we don't know) who had a drug addict son who killed himself (who we also don't know) and blames Charlie (which is stupid) . The obvious plot hole of Jim recommending Jerry take his place, but then says he doesn't know who Jerry is. And then Will's source happens to be the same vindictive guy, yet Will decides not to say anything? The thing about it all is. The Genoa story would've immediately been invalidated without MacKenzie resorting to checking the interview footage that showed the altered shot clock in the basketball game perpetrated by Jerry Dantana. The characters simply suspended simple reasoning when it came to looking over and qualifying the Genoa, and the writers overlooked what would actually happen if a news organization actually reported a story like Genoa.

&amp;#x200B;

But here are the main observations that I noticed that need to be conveyed on why the Genoa arc was so poorly written:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Charlie Skinner and the manifest. Yes the manifest had the invisible ink that enemy dude who wanted revenge on Charlie put on it (which is very contrived and poor writing). Let's be clear: Charlie didn't verify anything on that manifest and decided to run the Genoa report. He saw a vague code on the item list, and immediately just believed it was the sarin gas. And Charlie said he took the manifest to different quartermasters to verify its authenticity. How is it not one of those quartermasters caught the invisible ink ploy? Going on the premise that he believed it was an authentic mission manifest, he still didn't verify the mysterious item as the sarin gas. This was poor reporting. Charlie Skinner is who I shoulder most of the blame of the downfall of ACN over Genoa. I think the writers in season 2 didn't really pay attention to the kind of man Charlie Skinner is, because during season 2 Charlie seems to have suspended all his principles and reasoning that he laid on thick in the first season. In the first season Charlie was a very principled journalist in how news stories were to be reported. He was filtering about information presented to him, even if it was beyond doubt. During the episode where Sloan Sabath conducted the news in Japanese over the Fukashima crisis, he immediately shouted her down like a huge asshole in the middle of the newsroom in the most berating way possible. ""WE DON'T REPORT ON WHAT YOU THINK, SLOAN!!!""  And even calling for an elaborate investigation of all her past work because he thinks she's no longer credible as a reporter? Then he meets the old NSA guy about Reese secretly hacking phones. The news team confirms he's a legitimate NSA analyst, but Charlie brushes him off because his security clearance got downgraded, so Charlie feels the story will be contaminated using him. But in season 2, the OSI guy who had a stupid secret revenge plot against Charlie, hands him this manifest and gives some vague inferences about a mission, and Charlie just accepts it. Doesn't question him at all. Yet NSA guy getting downgraded for prostitution gets overlooked. Hell, even during Red Team III he says ""I BELIEVE IT'S THE SARIN"", not ""I CONFIRMED IT'S THE SARIN."" Charlie reported on what he believed, which makes him the most out of character of the season. 
2. The hamni8 tweet. One of the factors of the Genoa investigation was this fictional twitter. It turned out the the user's cell plan ran out, but the news team decided to believe he was killed during Genoa. Since Neal was behind investigating that, why didn't he figure that out? He found out the internet troll who was stalking Will in season 1 which is why he had a bodyguard. But more to the point, the news team had no information on the identity of who hamni8 even was, but yet was deemed credible for evidence for Genoa? No name or contact info. The problem I have with this is, in season 1, during the Egyptian revolution episode, Neal had a friend in Egypt willing to go out and film the events because Elliot was injured. MacKenzie on the other hand tells the informant that he needs to reveal his name and face, or otherwise the story won't have credibility. In which case I yelled at the TV ""But it does have credibility, he's f@#king there filming the Egyptian riots!"" The informant, Khalid, complies and reveals himself and gets captured by forces. Yet a twitter handle by an unknown person is perfectly suitable evidence. When Neal told the lawyers in the meeting ""I am not credible to judge the evidence"" I agree. And there was no evidence and certainly no judging being done by any of the characters involved.
3. The interview with the marine general. MacKenzie and Charlie meet a marine general they used as a key witness for Genoa. The marine general immediately figured out they were talking about sarin when discussing the Genoa mission. He agrees to do the interview, so obviously he's going to expect a question about if sarin was used in Genoa. So when Jerry Dantana directly asked him ""was sarin used in Genoa?"" the marine general decides to be stupid and answers ""if we used sarin...""  I yell at the TV even louder ""SIMPLY ANSWER NO!!!!"" Are the serious with this? A competent military executive would not open himself up with ""if we used"". He expected the question, he should've directly answered ""No"" and stuck with ""No"", not explain the logisitics of sarin, or ""if we used sarin."" He basically asked to be edited out of context. 
4. The pacing of the fallout of Genoa. After Genoa airs, the newsroom seems awfully quiet. The report got millions of viewers as Charlie reports to Will. The characters are seen sitting around waiting for a response from the government. But if this was reality now, upon watching the Genoa report, every other news organization in the world would be on the phone with ACN picking the Genoa story apart. Every news organization would've called their military and government sources to confirm Genoa, and then call ACN and ask what the hell did they just report? It would be a high stress and noisy newsroom with phones ringing every minute, not quiet and business as usual. They wouldn't even get to the meeting where everyone agrees to stick with the Genoa story. Genoa would've fallen much sooner. And Jerry Dantana revealing the TBI and that the solider lied about it, and that Maggie wasn't in the room. No serious journalist would've backed down from jerry's defensive tirade. I was waiting for Charlie to immediately call for an investigation of Jerry's reporting like he threatened with Sloan. Again characters not being logical. 

I'd like to hear if other fans have an opinion on this.",0

Which basically shuts Jerry up.

In the pilot episode Charlie tells Will a story from when he was in Da Nang. I've never been clear whether Charlie was in Vietnam as a reporter or a soldier, but AFAIK Mai Lai was the most prominent of the war crimes committed by the U.S. in Vietnam, perhaps the only one that saw a conviction of any kind...is it safe to say that's what Charlie was referencing in his response to Jerry?",0

56,"Two of my favorite scenes S03E03 -- 'Main Justice' -- has two of my favorite scenes in the entire show.

First, Mac meeting Jim and Don at the bar. So short but brilliantly executed, imo. The journey of these two characters (Jim and Don) goes from hostility (season 1) to mutual respect (season 2) and culminates in them basically becoming co-conspirators. They barely said anything in that scene, but you could tell that they straight up trusted each other with their lives. 

Second, the climate change interview. LMAO! They certainly cast that role right. Best part was the response to Will asking if he (the EPA guy) would get in trouble for saying what he said. ""Who cares?""

How were crossfire hurting America, from the very little research I have done on them [and I admit, it has been small], Crossfire's premise seemed to be bring on 2 people who know their stuff and are on opposite sides of an issue and let them debate on TV to show both sides of the story as much as possible. Which is basically what Will and the team tried to do. So what was wrong with how Crossfire did it that they were ""hurting America""?",0

The most prominent is from the first episode - I clearly remember a scene expanding on the one where Will and Charlie are talking in Charlie's office - it's right before they go to the staff meeting and Will yells ""I'm affable!!""

He yells that because I remember there being an exposition of breakdown. Talking about focus groups and audience opinions of Will before the outburst and of him afterwards.

70,"Just finished binging this for the first time [spoilers] My girlfriend loved it and I’ve heard good things so I jumped right in.

For me season 1 was by far the best. I liked the structure of each episode revolving around a major news story. Getting a handle on the different jobs and how everyone works to put the story on the air was fascinating.

Season 2 somewhat abandons that structure. While I did enjoy it overall, I found myself getting a little irritated at all of the romantic subplots. The only one I really bought into was Will and Mack’s. It wasn’t trying to be a screwball comedy but seemed to be about real people managing real issues.

Season 3 was really hit and miss for me. Maybe it was the fact that it was only 6 episodes but something about it just didn’t flow. Everything sort of seemed half developed: the sale of ACN, Jim confesses his love to Maggie. Will ending up in prison seemed like a stretch considering the screenplay re-emphasized every few minutes that reporters rarely go to jail for not revealing their sources.

All in all I enjoyed it but unfortunately I felt it peaked in season 1. I was invested in the characters and that carried me through to the end but it dropped off rather quickly. Thoughts?",0
71,"How S2 should have gone down? TL;DR: If Jerry hadn’t been introduced, who would have been responsible for Genoa? What would the fallout have been?

So, season 2 is my favorite season of the show by far. I loved the big story arc, plus the little arcs the characters had and their development. I like that kind of stuff. But I was reading about the show online, and I see a lot of people complaining about S2. Sometimes the fact that it had a big arc in the first place but also the fact that a new character (Jerry) is the one who fucks everything up. I see people wishing that one of the regulars had cocked up, which I admit is an interesting idea, and one that I wouldn’t have minded seeing. Who do you think would have (or should have) been responsible for the Genoa debacle? How would that character have been handled going forward?",0
72,"Regarding Will being a republican. The narrative that mainstream media seems to always want to dole out [Trevor Noah, Colbert report and at times, John Oliver] is that Republicans are ignorant, backwards people who want to kill all immigrants, gays and want your babies to be armed with guns right after birth.  
  
The Newsroom as well as my eventually being fed up with the narrative makes me think that that is not what Republicans are about. This in turn has made me want to find real republican shows that are more logical but's hard to find any show that is like those comedy stuff that I mentioned above and is republican.  
  
When I say is real republican, I am referring to the Republicans that is described Will in the episode where he basically rants to Charlie something about republican of today not representing what it originally was and how it was hijacked by the tea party to become what it is, which basically seems to just be the political party that always seems wrong on every major issue, even some that shouldn't be bipartisan issues.  
  
So, in short, is there any sensical logical current republican shows that are comedic in nature and also find the shiet that the Trump administration does to be infuriating or are Republicans really the villians that the mainstream media makes them out to be?",0

75,"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip was Aaron Sorkin’s warm up act for The Newsroom I rewatched The Newsroom and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip back to back a couple of weeks ago and came to the conclusion that Aaron just refined his writing of Studio 60 to produce the masterpiece that is The Newsroom. You can even spot identical lines recycled from studio 60 and put in the newsroom script. The structure of both shows is very similar, from the way they both open, through the relationships between the characters all the way to how the shows develop. That’s not to say they are not both excellent shows, I was just amused by the abundance of similarities. In fact if you haven’t watched studio 60 and you enjoyed the newsroom I highly recommend you check it out. Anyway, as I said, I just think we wouldn’t have had the polished jewel that is the newsroom if it wasn’t for the raw and rough around the edges studio 60 where Aaron got to try what works and what doesn’t in a workplace drama.",0
76,"bin laden episode how exactly does a murder of bin laden (or gadaffi) qualify as matter of american national security? I'd understand bin laden one if they killed him before 9/11, but after that, he's been hiding in caves, and a threat to no one. meanwhile to say gadaffi was a threat to anyone, a guy who thought he was safe, cause he was ""protecting europe from african migrants"" as he used to self describe, is just plain laughable, gadaffi was a threat smaller than a donut, as on donut you can chip a tooth, or get your blood sugar to soar, but what could have gadaffi ever do to anyone? he was like a kitten who can't see yet...

&amp;#x200B;

the excitement over it all, made no sense to me.oh we killed someone who wronged us 10 years go, go us. but let's make it hush hush, until 10:30, for no reason whatsoever, except to get everyone in state of panic for two hours for no reason whatsoever, and barely any payoff.

&amp;#x200B;

77,"Was this not a fairly significant plot hole in the series finale? I've been looking at a bunch of episodes yet again for the umpteenth time when this occurred to me. Now, I could understand if there was a certain amount of the fandom that wasn't thrilled with the season 3 aka series finale. With all the flashback stuff they put in, that it might've been putting a kind of finer point on the series as a whole than what was needed.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's one particular thing that, far as I can tell, ends up playing as a hard, direct contradiction to what we'd known previously. Of course so much of the drama during season 1 comes from how antagonistic Leona Lansing is toward Will and what they're trying to do on the show once Mac comes back. That she's put off by how Will is genuinely trying to make politicians and other big shots accountable for their behavior (especially it being people whose political help she may need).  In 01x03 in the board room meeting with Charlie, she even says *""What happened to breast cancer, all the human interest stuff? He was great at that shit!""*... *""He was sleeping while doing that shit.""*... *""And whose idea was it to wake him up?""*

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, makes for a compelling face off between two strong personalities during that scene, but here's the problem: during the series finale, we're shown in the flashbacks a moment where Will is still down at Barbados (or whatever island resort he was at) on his vacation after the Northwestern incident, but before he's returned to work. He receives a call at the bar from Leona, her asking him if he's okay, basically making sure he's not having a nervous breakdown or anything. Will says in a very calm, but matter-of-fact way, *""Leona, I'd like to actually finally do the news""*. To which Leona replies ***""So who's stopping you?""*** and then she hangs up.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, does that imply (if not very directly suggest) to anyone else that Leona is already right then giving Will the thumbs up, the green light, whatever you wanna call it, to approach the reporting of news in exactly the way he starts to upon returning? It sure as hell seems to me she'd be impressed and even proud that he'd finally become the type of news anchor that he then is for the bulk of the series.",0

However, above all, what I love the most is Mackenzie Mchale. Emily Mortimer does a fantastic and beautiful job of brining this character to life imo. I can not get enough of her relationship to Will. I love the back and forth, her 'cuteness', and the ultimate love between them. (I can just sense its coming). As the character said about herself, she is 'beautiful, intelligent, and vital'. Kinda makes me jealous, which I had someone like that...(woah, sorry, that topic is for another day)

116,"Blown fact check You know something absolutely minor that bugs the shit out of me, and has since the first time I watched it the first time it aired on HBO like 4 years ago.

In Season 3, when Will and Mac and Charlie and the lawyer go before the government lawyer, and the govt lawyer makes a point to say Nebraska didn't recruit him so he had to go to Texas A&amp;M instead, and the implication is this is for football (strongly because of the guy's size and shape, and because the only sport that matters at Nebraska and A&amp;M is football).  He says he lost to Nebraska all 4 years he was there, and that he hated it (to which Will quips ""really I thought you would have gotten used to it."")  We all know that The Newsroom is a fictional news network with fictional people that exists in our reality; that everything is the same other than these people and this network exist and this is how the cover news, act, interact, etc.

Never, at any point in history, have Nebraska and Texas A&amp;M played each other 4 straight years.  Yes, they were both in the Big XII for awhile, but when they were in the Big XII they were in different divisions and at most played each other twice in 4 years.  And more than that, based on the implied ages of these characters, they would have been at these respective schools long before the Big XII was formed (which was like 1996).

This is minor, and borderline meaningless, but also stupid that they couldn't get it right.  For as much as I LOVE this show, and am now finishing up probably my 5th watch-through of it, it's annoying they couldn't get this right.  It's a detail so simple, I'm amazed not one person on the writing team said anything.  All they would've had to do is change Texas A&amp;M to Oklahoma, one of Nebraska's historical rivals for about 60 years up until 2010 or so.

It has annoyed me for years, and now I'm sharing it with you all.  It's 1:24am central time, and I have a sleeping 16-month old, and I have work in 7 hours.  Don't judge me, I'm watching the episode where Charlie dies.",0
117,"Season 3 : Run - spotting a familiar face I just caught Mary McCormack playing the FBI Agent Levy and recognised her from West Wing (Kate Harper).
I just love seeing how time has changed actors - Mary looked great but obviously older and maybe a little heavier, which is how life goes. No obvious Hollywood facelifts here. I love that Aaron stays true to actors he has worked with and gives us the opportunity to see them again.

118,"Just finished season 2 - did sorkin know if he had a season 3 at that point? I loved that a lot of story arcs were wrapped up in the finale. However the last 15 mins or so did seem a little frantic. Maybe it was intentional, or maybe it was rushed, to close as many storylines as possible so if it wasn’t renewed, the viewers had resolution. 
Was season 3 already commissioned at that point?",0

120,"[Season Three Episode Five] - (Spoilers) When Will was in prison, was he hallucinating? I just rewatched the episode for the third time, and noticed something new. Will has three pictures on the wall; one of Mac, one of the entire gang, and one of young will and his father. During the episode, Will is sharing a prison cell with another man. He has many deep discussions with the man, who knows lots about will. The man even knows that Will was beaten by his father at a young age. 
I thought this was just a coincidence, but at the end of the episode it cuts to will taking down the pictures, and it is revealed his father in the picture was the same man in the cell. 
Then, I looked up the post show interview on HBO with Sorkin, where he reveals that it was Will’s father all along.
So yes- will was hallucinating that he was seeing his dad after over 50 days in solitary. I feel like this is an amazing piece of writing by Sorkin and staff, as it was a physical interpretation of the main conflict within Will over the 2.5 previous seasons. ",0

As a lawyer who said she is looking at a 17 million dollar apartment and is obviously successful and good at what she does presumebly why does she not prep the staff for potential trouble they can into by saying or doing certain things by predicting the legal strategies by Jerry and his lawyers?

I've worked with many corporate lawyers and they spend a lot of time addressing possible outcomes and instructing clients what to watch out for.

An example is when Jerry calls for a job reference knowing they'll give a terrible one and in not warning them about this strategy they get sued again.

What's her deal? No competent lawyer would realistically not see this coming or worse not instruct their clients to watch what they say if and when Jerry's next legal move is executed.

The first BlackBerry Bold 9900/9930 I have found is in S1E6, where the date is announced to be April 11, 2011. You can see Mack holding one in her left hand after she pulls Jim and Maggie out of the rundown early in the episode. There may be earlier instances, but there are plenty of later ones that come before BlackBerry released the 9900 line in November of that year. When I saw her holding one, it stuck out to me as quite odd.

My question is why a show so focused on timeline continuity and so many close up scenes with mobiles would let something like that happen. Would a news company like ACN have early access to phones like this? Also has anyone else noticed similar continuity errors?",0

Then again in Season 2, he explains to Rebecca Halliday exactly how the *Challenger* disaster happened. 

I was discussing the show with a friend and he made the point that characters in Sorkin shows tend to always know the information in conversations like they had prepared for every conversation beforehand.

I can only assume that it's a reference to Huckleberry Finn, but aren't those books literary classics? Are they actually considered bad writing? Or is it a reference to something else?",0
158,"When did Will work on-air at CNN? I just finished rewatching the series and it's revealed in the last episode that Mac and Will worked together at CNN, albeit for a short period of time. While this takes care of why Charlie and her had never met before the bowling alley, it doesn't add up with the story presented earlier in the series, where Will's first appearance on-air was on the night of 9/11.

Am I missing something? Am I putting the puzzle together incorrectly? Or was this really the insanely obvious continuity error I think it might be?",0
159,"I don't think Sorkin ever read Don Quixote Okay, this is not a complete argument or even a complete thought, but stay with me. I'm 18, so I was (fairly) young when Newsroom first aired. Since it went off, I actually read Don Quixote by Cervantes and absolutely loved it. Changed my life.

Now I'm rewatching, and they get a lot of things wrong! From what I can gather, it seems like every Don Quixote reference is really just a reference to the musical ""Man of La Mancha"", which isn't really an adaptation but more of a story about the story.

In the pilot, Will corrects Mac by pointing out she had quoted the musical, not the book. But seconds later he corrects her statement on his steed by saying he rode a donkey, not a horse. This isn't true, he rode a horse named Rocinante (Sancho rode a donkey). He even reiterates this later with Charlie.

In a later episode (S1E10), Will talks about how Quixote was defeated by the Knight of the Mirrors, as he showed the protagonist who he really was. This happens in the musical, but in the book the Knight of the Mirrors is actually defeated by Quixote and is in fact also a man dressed in fake armor. At the end of the episode he gets up from the hospital bed reciting the words ""What is illness to the body of our knight errant? What matter wounds?"" and Charlie says he's reciting the end of Don Quixote.

Nope. It's from the musical.

Now obviously none of this is of consequence, the show is still compelling and I appreciate the references. And who knows, maybe it's the characters just fucking up. But it's become a small peeve that it seems as though Sorkin (a known musical theater fan) is making references to classic literature, only using knowledge from the musical ""adaptation"".

And I guess I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy.

163,"the voter ID laws in the greater fool confused me... when they investigate the voter ID laws that were passed to ensure that only people who were actually citizens of America could vote, they portray it as a negative thing. They went on to say that its being implemented with an agenda of making sure certain citizens who's votes arent what some candidates want cant vote.  
  
I am confused on why certain citizens dont have govt ID. in the episode they used the case of an elderly Tennesse resident who cant vote because she doesnt have a passport because she never planned to travel overseas and doesnt have a drivers license because she never learned to drive. in Canada, at least in British Columbia, we have 2 different govt IDs that we can use for identification besides a drivers' license or a passport. BCID which as the name suggests is is just a card to provide a person with a govt ID in case they dont have a license as well as the card we use for Medical Services Plan which is tied to our Medical information [ie health insurance and so forth]. Ive never seen someone who doesn't have some type of identification and even my grandmother who indeed never learned to drive and doesnt use her passport for day to day ID still has a BCID and the Medical Services Card just for day to day identification purposes.  
  
Which makes me wonder if its fair of this Tennesse woman to be upset that she cant vote when to me it seems like its actually her fault because she never bothered to get the proper ID. unless, in America, or Tennessee, they dont have the same ability to get a govt ID that isnt tied to their driving capacity?",0

The other real-world engine option for the 787, besides the RR Trent 1000, is the General Electric GEnx.

174,"Can someone tell me what Sorkin did wrong in Oh Shenandoah? This episode is incredibly controversial because of the conversations between Don and Mary, but for the life of me I do not know why. 
Mary is right about the pamphlets, about the advice, she has an answer for everything Don says. Don points out there are two sides, that allowing anonymous posts on the internet that accuse people of heinous crimes sets a dangerous precedent (which I think has been proven repeatedly since then) and Mary responds with her point of view - that it is a public service, that she feels she has a duty. She even admits it might be used for revenge - a fake story - but she believes it is still worth it. 
He also tries to protect her from being humiliated on national television (and does anyone think that her facing off against her rapist would end well for her?) and points out that if we believe accused murderers get the benefit of the doubt, why not accused rapists?
Given that Sorkin is credited as the chief writer, it is likely he wrote both sides of the dialog, so while he wrote Don's lines, he also wrote Mary's. 
I have watched this a dozen times, and I cannot see what he did wrong. Given that the show is all about presenting both sides of a story, that News Night 2.0 is about presenting facts (which both Don and Mary do) and letting the audience (in this case - us) decide for themselves, then how else could it have been written? Should he have only presented one side (Mary's side? Or Don's side?) to the story? Would that have made it better?",0

Anyone with an encyclopedic knowledge of the dialog (or willing to fast forward through the series again) recall the back and forth about Sports? 

I’m not talking about the “You mean like trying out for a team?” line, although that might be the setup for it.  It was about how important issues and developments were being covered as though they were sporting events — this political team scored these points (votes), that jury scored those points (damages), this company scored a touchdown (earnings report), and that without covering the issues it all devolves into sports coverage.

Sorkin seemed to be positing that the people we think of as ""elite"" are not to be reviled and made into the enemy, but rather are just normal, everyday people who are in their positions because they earned them, not simply because they ""knew somebody"" or were living in their ""ivory tower, etc.""

That public service would be one hour of air time set aside every night for informational broadcasting, or what we now call the evening news.""

I've looked all over to get a source for this. I've looked at Wikipedia articles on Paley, Sarnoff, and the Federal Communications Act of 1934, but I've found nothing on the fact that networks had to provide a 1-hr news broadcast.

204,"How I felt about the ending The newsroom was a show that described what I would like an ideal media to be like: bold, unafraid, and always ready to call out bullshit when it needed to be done.



It wasn't just about that, though: I grew very attached to the characters. The drama, the romance, all of it. It was just so good to see how their lifes played out even out of the newsroom. That's the main reason I binge watched it... I hadn't watched a show like that in a long time.



It was awesome to see conservatives get called out on a lot of their non-sensical views, it was awesome to watch the never ending struggles happening all the time with all the characters: Jim-Maggie, Don-Sloan, Will-Mackenzie romances, Charlie and everyone always doing their best to just do a good show, that informed people instead of sacrificing actual important information for the sake of audience. 

Yes, it was a bit pretentious and almost arrogant sometimes, but that's what it needed to be and a lot of people in the real world do need to be called out on their opinions (because it often happens that their ""opinion"" goes against logic and even facts), and the show did an awesome job at that. There are a lot that would say the show took actual events with the benefit of hindsight (which I don't consider a bad thing), or that a great part of the show was just Aaron Sorkin being verysmart... I don't really agree.

That being said, I felt like the end was fitting: life goes on, those struggles will continue to be never ending and everyone will keep figthing the good fight. I wish Charlie hadn't died and thought it was downright shitty to have him agreeing to all the shit Ryan (don't remember the actual characters name, just thought of the name from the office) did, but he died fighting. The ending even gave the show a chance for revival, even though that's very unlikely to happen. Eventually they ran out of real news, and it would be shitty to make them up just so the show could go on.

208,"Found something that kinda fills the void I just started watching the shows from the last few months, and stumbled upon one that sounded similar in theme at least to the newsroom, so added it to my watching list. It's called Graves and it features a American President who was in the job a while before, strong conservative who has come to regret his decisions and policies. Starting wars, being homophobic, punishing illegals harder and stripping medical funding are some of the things he did that he has come to regret and is trying to make amends for.
Its nowhere like for like, Graves is much more political and less of a mission, no mission to civilize like Will had, just a old guy who wants to try and make amends and right the wrongs he caused. It is also a lot gaudier and low brow than the Newsroom. Though the fire is there and the passion that the Newsroom has. Its against a backdrop of a wife considering accepting a offer to run for a political office and the two kids having their own issues.

I believe in common sense realities, and the necessity to defend ourselves against a dangerous world, and that’s about it. Problem is, now I have to be homophobic. I have to count the number of times people go to church. I have to deny facts, and think scientific research is a long con. I have to think poor people are getting a sweet ride.

It seemed like he called himself a Republican throughout the whole show, yet never once did I see him do or say anything that a Republican would. Even the left side of the Republican party greatly supported Romney, and the way Will attacked him incessantly was uncanny for someone claiming to be a Republican.

The second is the mock debate.  The third is in Lisa and Maggie's apartment at the end of the episode.  In all three scenes he is wearing a jacket or sweater.  The reason this is notable is because as Reese mentioned in Blackout I this is supposed to be the hottest this particular day in NYC has ever been.

In the first scene, Will even asks Don why he is wearing the jacket and Don responds that his own office is ""Ice station zebra.""  In the second scene all of the candidate representatives are wearing sweaters so no note is made.  In the third scene he walks into the room rubbing his hands together saying something about not being able to fix the AC so they are stuck with either ""90 degrees or 30.""  I guess the assumption is that it is currently 30 because of his thick jacket, but Maggie is wearing a very thin sweater and Lisa's outfit is sleeveless.

I'm probably nitpicking about a minor detail but it's bothering me.

It is Sancho Panza that rides a donkey. I know its a minor detail to nitpick, but I have a great deal respect for Aaron Sorkin (longtime fan of west wing, sports night, and the newsroom) and Don Quixote's steed is such a significant part of the book that it seems the only way he could make this mistake is if he never actually read it himself.

264,"Is The Newsroom Sorkin's greatest work of television? I've just completed re-re-re-(etc)-watching the show and I had a thought. Sports Night was good. The West Wing was phenomenal. Studio 60 had real promise but was cut short. The Newsroom had time to grow and explore some interesting arcs. For me, The West Wing will always be the absolute pinnacle but I think due in equal measure to the cast and to the writing.

Considering only the seasons of WW that Sorkin wrote (up to S4 I think) which show would you say is the absolute best example of his televisual writing, and why?

IMO, The Newsroom wins handily. It had some great snappy banter that was in some ways missing in S60, which was for a long time my benchmark for good writing. It didn't ever rely on the tried-and-tested walk &amp; talk that by now is a trope. The stories were interesting and the behind-the-scenes look at reports on real life events made it more real, like it was a true fly-on-the-wall type show. The way you could see Will put his psyche back together over the course of the show. Genius.

I love WW, I love S60, but Newsroom is my new favourite Sorkin show.

I knew it would be Charlie. I was hoping I'd be wrong, and maybe, perhaps Maggie would be the one to die.

I was cheering on Sloane as she was ripping apart not-Neal about the Gawker Stalker thing he was in charge of.

Then down comes Charlie to tear holes in Mac and Sloane. That's when I realized Charlie only has seconds before he drops. I knew it was coming, and when it did happened, I still jumped and teared up. It was made worse by Charlie hitting his head on the way down. And then they had to rip off his bow tie.

And then they let us in on the fact that Will never had a cell mate at all, and he was just talking to his dead father.

And now he's free, and everything is fine! Except for the part that Charlie is dead!

I remember in season one he had a text from Biden or something, which if I was in Will's position I would consider just as good as POTUS, But I couldn't imagine Biden feeding Will that much disinformation.

I can say that the moment I audibly said ""this is where he lost it"" when Leona showed up high in ep 7.  It was great to see Jane Fonda act like that, but the whole thing seemed forced.  Knowing that the show was on a limited run, I felt that was the beginning of the end.  There were three distinct  moments I had to look away.  The show went from captivating to cringe inducing. (I'm sorry to use that word, but that the best way to describe it.) And goddamn, do I want to punch B.J. Novac in the face every time I see him.  So good at playing a douche.

Now we get the grand send off.  Six episodes for Sorkin to shine and give us all an amazing ending.  What do we get?  Another death only to create drama.  But it's ok because Will and Mac are having a baby.  And you want to use a good portion of your last 65 minutes for each main characters ACN origin story.  

I can see why there are only 25 episodes.  It had the possibility to run as long as West Wing did.  He just lost the thread 3/4ths of the way through the second season.  I think it would have lasted a lot longer if he didnt try to make it so complicated.  There will be recommendations it to anyone who hasnt seen it because the good parts are just so damn good.  ",0

I thought Bill Nye, The Science Guy, was also an actor who played Charlie Skinner in The Newsroom. And I guess I thought there was some continuation with the colorful bowties across his life and playing this character.

313,"Jim and Maggie A belated question regarding Jim and Maggie. The series seemingly ends with the two finally together. But during the flashbacks, we learned that Jim previously had a long-term relationship, which did not work out. And indeed, during the show, we see Jim attempt a long-term relationship, which doe not work out. Now Jim says that this time it'll work because he's truly in love, and I took that at face value when I watched the finale. Jim was in love with MacKenzie while overseas, after all, and he was in love with Maggie while back home.

But a thought occurred to me today -- is it possible that, in fact, we're just seeing Jim enter into another long-term relationship that will fail? We've seen Jim fail pretty consistently at maintaining relationships in the show. I know some have suggested that the main story of the show is the Jim and Maggie love story (it's what ties together the full series, from beginning to end), but is it possible that in fact, the show has foreshadowed a less than good end to this love story?

I love watching and rewatching the Newsroom and I'm watching Season 3 now and as stated in the title, I really am having a problem sympathizing with and/or liking Neil as well as feeling that ACN was in the right morally.  

* First off.  I don't like how naive he is with the receiving of the data.  A guy like that should know what is right/wrong when it comes to this data.
* I don't like how he tries to be all tough with Will in Episode 2.  Wanting to go to jail is self indulgent and a way to get manufactured credibility.   
* I think that he and Will should absolutely have given up the source and making them seem like heroes.  Not to say what was done by the marketing company was acceptable, but the FBI was right in that the source could have spilled information that could put assets in the field in jeopardy.   
* Mac was the only one that acted admirably in that she threatened the source that she will reveal her if she doesn't give them the time to vet everything.  
* Will saying he ""couldn't give the source"" is just NOT a true statement.  He didn't want to.  Simple as that.  There was nothing meta-physically stopping him from doing so.  Him not verifying it after her death was him being a dick.  He could have easily done so ""via the side door"" as his lawyer put it to end it all.   He was totally wrong.  
* Neil was a SUPER DICK at the end when he told that one guy he was ashamed of him.  The guy just was doing his job that the new ownership wanted him to do.  He was embarrassed by Sloan on TV because she is friends with Erin Andrews.  He comes back from Venezuela after committing espionage and he is ashamed of him?   

Again, love the show but it's sometimes very hard being a fan of Sorkin with stuff like this.  He was like this in Studio 60 as well (very preachy about the Christian Right/Hannah) but was much more even handed on the West Wing.

334,"Neil Sampat ... a bit unrealistic ? Just a thought i wanted to share. 
Neil starts the show as a blog writer for Will, which is completely credible for a journalist that knows a thing or two about the web.
Later on, apparently he got promoted to handling the entire ACN website operation (one man gig?, kind of an over reach, but still believable). 
The next step is the one that throws  me off. He becomes a hacktivist computer wiz with the ability to create encryptions that are even difficult to crack for the FBI? 
Someone with those types of skills wouldn't be working for a cable network for sure. 
Lets say that he stays with the network just because of the bigger picture. He wanted  to use his skills for the greater good. 
However, if he had all these skills from the moment he enters ACN, before ""the mission to civilize"" starts, 
why da fuq would he accept a job as a blog writer?

http://np.reddit.com/r/Thenewsroom/comments/2lu24j/if_i_love_the_newsroom_should_i_go_watch_the_west/
asking if I should watch the west wing.
Well, the responses were overwhelmingly in favor of me getting off my ass and watching the west wing immediately, which brings me to the first ""I hate you guys"" because my thoughts after a few episodes were along the lines of ""7 seasons, 22 episodes a season, what have I gotten myself into?!?""
Of course I fairly quickly became obsessed with the show, and am still amazed that I never discovered it when it was new to TV, leading me to ""I love you guys"" for introducing me to it.
But, sadly, last night I finally watched the last (three) episodes.  and now I hate everyone and everything for not having new West Wing episodes in my life anymore!  Woe is me! What do I do now?!

Anyway, thanks all for getting me on board with the West Wing.  I truly found it to be some of the best television I've ever watched, and not one minute of it was wasted.

It did what I expected but deviated with inane, unnecessary subplots. 

What it should have been was simply News Night and behind the scenes of the show. Have a breaking news drama (that actually entered the broadcast - how was that not done?). Have a subplot with Will's father's death. Have the bullshit twitter thing. Have the Genoa story arc expanded upon.

I was expecting a production-side/on-air broadcast plot only. It would have been great. 

Why did they fluff up the episode with the nudie pic sideplot? The lengthy timeline disparity is confusing as hell, especially with Maggie having her exact usual haircut after the end of the previous ep being her cutting it off and appearing at the examination.

401,"[Spoiler] Review: The Newsroom Series Finale, “What Kind of Day Has it Been” ",0
402,"[Spoilers all] My Newsroom Retrospective, The Good, The Bad, and the Unfinished The Newsroom ended last night. Watched the finale and obviously I felt it during the closing lines of Sam Waterson's Charlie Skinner ""We did the news well because, we just decided to"" - A call back to the episode title of the Pilot episode. The short lived emotion I felt in that scene was shrouded by the cloud that the show never was what it could have been.

As a huge fan of Aaron Sorkin's ""The West Wing"" (and as a passive viewer of ""Studio 60"") I was beyond elated to hear the news of his new HBO show about a news network. The buzz came slowly but steady as we learned of the amazing casting for the show. The first promo spot featuring Jeff Daniels amazing rant about why we ""aren't the best country in the world - but we can be"" really struck home with me. In college I was a bit of a political activist, but like most people, the more you learn about the way the world works, the more you become disheartened by anyone with a voice or ability to change it.

I was looking forward to a smart show, would slap the face of partisanship and give me an intellectually stimulating drama to the same effect that ""The West Wing"" gave me, but even better. It's on HBO, shorter seasons (means less filler and fluff) the ability to use adult language and situations when necessary. I was ready with my eyes wide open.

This is not to say my ""expectations of a follow up to 'The West Wing'"" were too high. I was simply looking for what I felt was being advertised, which is less than the show ended up being.

Within the first season the show was trying extremely hard to ""out quirk"" itself. With the show belittling itself to a campy cute romantic comedy at times. I'm no one to shy away from love stories in shows by any means, but the show diluted itself with multiple love stories before really giving us one to truly care about. It became clear it was Will-Mack and Jim-Maggie but it really felt forced on us before it even got into the character development. The show did the equivalent of what ""News Night"" was so adamantly against. They were trying to please a larger audience instead of telling the story they wanted to tell. It came out as a show that I wasn't sure if I was supposed to really believe these love stories or if the show was trying to make social commentary about the media's role in the sociopolitical landscape with the protagonists actively trying to inform their viewers of issues that effect them in a bipartisan way and the antagonists were dumbing it down for ratings and harming civil discourse because of it.

Within 2 or 3 episodes, I simply felt we were being dumbed down the way Reese Lansing would have and that Sorkin was capable of so much better than this. The Gabby Giffords episode ""I'll Try To Fix You"" ended with an amazing emotional climax and music montage, perhaps a cheap effect albiet, but it was SMART. ""Doctor pronounces people dead, not the news"" I was hopeful once again. I still will sometimes look back to the ending of that episode to remember how good it was.

It picked up in it's second season but not enough, ultimately the show was cancelled and Aaron Sorkin seemed to admit he dropped the ball on the entire series. A series finale for a show with just 25 episodes (just 3 more than the first season of 'The West Wing', and that show had 7 seasons) was strangely unemotional for me, but it the end I still *felt it* and that what I wanted the show to do. I did a few times, but simply not enough.

With a show I watch until the end I usually have two reactions, ""Oh I wish it didn't end so soon but what a ride"" or ""It was time for the show to end"" (With the latter usually being the case unfortunately) but my reaction to this show was incredibly unique, because while I understand why it ended so soon, I really wished it could have had the chance to be the show I wanted it to be, which it so carefully toyed with so many times. I imagine the emotional apex of Charlie's death and Mack taking over as President being so impactful after 5-6 seasons, but that's not how the cards fell and I have to deal with that.

The show had such an amazing ensemble cast, perhaps one of the most intellectual show runners ever, a great writing staff, a great network, it seemed to have everything, but for some reason it just never got it's chance to come together. The biggest shame is that we won't ever get a chance to see that cast again together.

413,"Why hating the finale might be what the writers wanted. (Spoilers)     So my friend and I got together to watch the final episode. He bought a cheap bottle of Jameson Whiskey to toast to Charley and the end of one of our favorite shows. (Yes, we are total nerds) 
   Within 15 minutes we HATED it. I felt that several flashbacks manipulated characters in a way the fit only the narrative of the finale. The most blatant was the idea that Don was always a true believer in portraying only the news. (I watched season 1 last week, mostly because I have too much time on my hands after finals) First season Don felt so much different from Finale flashback Don. I also hated the whole notion that Charley secretly wanted the staff of the newsroom to fight with him. (making it seem his heart burst from  joy) I felt that Charley was genuinely flighting to keep the staff from being fired. It seemed that Sloan and company had utterly broken the peace Charley had brokered. The flashbacks told how Charley was the puppet master behind the changes to Will's show, what I wondered was who didn't know that. I felt that the flashbacks beat us over the head on this idea.  The guitar scene was… well… Like I said before, my friend and I hated the episode.
     So after a couple of shots, our swearing began to give way to discussion. I brought up that hating the episode might be what the writers actually wanted. I just finish taking 2 semesters of Theatre History. Last semester we studied ""Three Penny Opera."" (stick with me) The play is about a rogue that keeps dodging punishment by the law and the thieves guild. (rough summary) In the end he is about to be hung, and then out of nowhere the queen comes and saves him, duex machina style. The ending is abrupt and offers little explanation. Most consider it an unsatisfactory ending to good play. The ending is so abrupt that it takes the audience out of the illusion of the play. It allows the audience to think about what they just saw rather than just continuing to watch mindlessly. 

So, do you think there is any chance that this explain why the Newsroom ending seems so unfulfilling? 

Other arguments that we came up with were: This was Sorkin's tribute to himself. The writers couldn't figure out to end it, so they went with the Wayne's World happy ending. Sorkin gave up. HBO said no to a darker ending.

We also realized that we would probably not be happy with any ending.

We see it with Randy/Blaire where they want to strike out on their own. They don't care if 100k people lose their jobs, they want to have the experience of doing it on their own and getting in touch with their entrepreneurial side. 

Similarly, Pruitt doesn't care if he succeeds or fails with the news. He has the money, so he wants to use ACN and all the people who work there as experiments to see if his way of doing the news will work, and so that he, personally, can learn from the experience. ",0

451,"Title Interpretation for S03E05 Hey all.

So I was thinking about what the title represents. The song is, of course, beautiful. 

This is what I found online.

""Shenandoah"" (also called ""Oh Shenandoah"", or ""Across the Wide Missouri"") is an American folk song, dating to the early 19th century. The lyrics may tell the story of a roving trader in love with the daughter of an Indian chief; in this interpretation, the rover tells the chief of his intent to take the girl with him far to the west, across the Missouri River. Other interpretations tell of a pioneer's nostalgia for the Shenandoah River Valley in Virginia, and a young woman who is its daughter; or of a Union soldier in the American Civil War, dreaming of his country home to the west of the Missouri river, in Shenandoah, Iowa (though the town lies some 50 miles east of the river).

Yeah, i think the complete opposite of what newsroom is getting bashed for.  they didn't present a case that makes it harder for rape victims, they actually lay out a complete discussion about how awfully hard it is to deal with something like that on the backend and how there's no good way out.  what can they possibly do?  it's like the deck is stacked against them.  




---




sorry went on a tangent, but yeah, if only they could do a follow up movie (firefly did), i'd definitely think the center news story could revolve around what's happening in the US today with all the cops killing African Americans and getting off.  they're getting wrecked in public (not saying they shouldn't here, or that they should, just reality), and in a situation not involving any of these cases, if a white cop were in the right, they would have no shot publicly, just like the af-ams getting shot have no shot in the justice system right now.  AS did do a similar storyline in West Wing about a white cop and a black kid, and that was very deep.  but it was all towards a political situation and the type of convo they just had about rape.  (I do have to say, AS isn't shying away from any topic)  WW does address race a ton, multiple charlie storylines, reparations, the cop, the comedian, some of the appointed officials, etc etc.  but all political.  




---



there's tons of staff sotrylines he could use for the movie too.  maggie making the big jump if she doesn't in episode 6, jim/maggie wedding, some more neal stuff, or whatever's happening to the staff later.  the show is so good at designing the antagonist as not a person but an internal struggle reflected in different people.  ratings and entertainment vs moral journalism.  ugh... why is it ending?!? did it have to end for AS to write this season?  this season is way way way better than the other two.  



i say this wearing a hoodie over a t-shirt that says ""i can't breath"", holding my hands up saying ""hands up don't shoot"".  it's hurting and i can't think my way out of it.

I want, for the record, to state that I am a male journalist. I work for a medium sized print publication with a similar style of staff to the news room. I'd most liken myself to Don, in that it's my job to meet with people and get their story. Find out things about them.

I think there are three things that need to be discussed. 
1. Was what Don saying bad/wrong/evil? 
2. Was what Mary doing the ethically right thing to do?
3. What was the point Sorkin was trying to make?



I'll go first to get things rolling.

**Was what Don saying bad/wrong/evil?**

I think Don was playing the ""Justice System"" card, which is ultimately Sorkin's message. (I'll get to this later.) I don't think Don is wrong in what he said but he doesn't offer what I think to be a good solution. I believe he's not saying she's lying, (when she accused him of it I immediately and audibly was like no...that's not what he's saying), I believe he's saying that because of the way the law works, without further evidence, it's her word against his and we know how that all plays out. So I don't think he's a ""rape apologist"" or whatever the critics are saying.

**Is what Mary is doing the ethically right thing to do?**

Ethics are different for everyone and I hope we all think about the website and how it will effect people. 

I draw a similar correlation to the herpes alert website, because like herpes, if you're raped that's something I feel stays with a person forever. 
We all know that there are a ton of people on there who have herpes and aren't telling their partners. We also know there is a percentage of people on there that are 100% herpes free and someone wanted to harm them in that manner for that reason.

So the ethical question for us all is this: Is the damage caused to rapists worth the damage to non rapists? 

I think a lot of people will say that for every false report of rape there are 1000000000000 rapes that are not prosecuted (I'm exaggerating because I don't know the figures but I know it's a high ratio) and there are 10000000000000000 more rapes that aren't reported. 

But that's not the idea. We all agree that any amount of rape is a bad thing and any rapist should be punished. But are we willing to overlook that there will be collateral damage and those people will never get justice either? Aren't we just creating more victims that won't have justice over people that harmed them?

To me there has to be a better way. I don't know what it is, but there has to be it. The anonymous way it hypothetically would be reported to me seems a little backwords. Maybe I'm wrong but in court if you accuse someone of rape, they have the right to know who it was. Shouldn't the same apply to the accused of rape? 

**What was the point that Sorkin was trying to make?**
I think there are three reasons this story was put in. One, they needed to actually look like they're working. Two, Don needed a reason to fight against the owner. Three, Sorkin is questioning how our justice system works. 

Our law works (or doesn't depending on your point of view) by operating under the idea that everyone is innocent until a jury of your peers believes you are guilty beyond reasonable doubt. 

I personally believe ""slut shaming"" --saying the victim was wearing something, doing something or ""indicating something"" that meant the victim wanted to have sex should not be allowed as evidence. The victim either said yes or she said no. The victim was either capable of making that decision or not. When we are very clear about what we, as a society to be rape, then I think the law can be better enforced. 

Anyway, what is everyone else's thoughts on the episode and the following discussion. 

I'm curious to see what everyone says. (I also apologize for grammar mistakes and if this discussion is to much about rape and not enough about the newsroom if so Mods feel free to delete.)

I am not ready for it to be over. It is a tragedy that more people don't appreciate the genius in this show. Damn you Sorkin. That is all. ",0
478,"What Sorkin (and his characters) don't understand about ""young people"" and their relationship with the media. *""Young people know when they're being talked down to""*.  This isn't the first show I've seen this sentiment expressed on, but Sorkin's take is especially hilarious in his obtuseness because the entire foundation of The Newsroom's hero's is on faulty ground.  The show and it's characters are fighting for a dying institution/medium.  It's over. The genie can't go back into the bottle. The internet, and the ""new media"" will only grow, and it's up to the old media to figure out how to adapt, or die.

Instead of condescending to the new generation about sensationalized headlines and bite-sized tidbits, versus in-depth coverage and contrasting opinions, it might be worthwhile to actually examine what is it about the digital world today that leads to these new information consumption patterns.

Despite all romanticism to the contrary, the ""old-school"" journalism that Sorkin portrays is not without faults. Fundamentally, it is a question of depth vs breadth. The world used to move a lot slower, and access to information was a lot harder, so depth was a natural approach. News stories and scandals would dominate the conscious and subconscious debate for longer periods of time. The cost of this was missing out and ignoring deeper scandals and letting them go on behind the scenes.  Numerous big stories (The Gulf of Tonklin, the british parliamentary pedophile ring, etc) were able to stay hidden throughout history because the average citizen did not have access to a distribution network with the power of the internet. 

In today's faster moving world, the new generation demands access to more information. More voices. More stories. More breadth. It's not a short attention span issue, it's a desire to not to have the veil pulled over our eyes like the old media loves to do, and always has done.  Reporting on ""tweets"" from ""citizen journalists"" during hour 4 of a 6 hour coverage of Casey Anthony is certainly not the answer, and The Newsroom is right to criticize it, but it's just a desperate attempt from the old media to stay relevant, it's not the next evolution.  The internet, the daily beast, slate, and hell, even buzzfeed with its long form journalism, and other sites just like it is what the future looks like. In 20 years, no one outside of a senior's home is going to be sitting down to watch news on the TV during a regularly scheduled hour.  I'm not saying THIS approach isn't without flaws either, but it's inevitable, and everyone needs to figure out how to work within it, rather than pining for the good ol' days.

The show tries desperately to villify visionaries who see the writing on the wall - to present them as immature kooky billionaires full of buzzwords and no valuable ideas.  But that's simply not how things work in the real world. And before you mention The New Republic to me, there are more examples that contradict their example than those that support it.  Whether it's Jeff Bezos buying the Washington Post, or the The New York Times successfully evolving into the 21st century, we know it can be done.

So yes, young people know when they're being talked down to. They know when they are being talked down to by an aging institution (Television drama) fighting for an aging institution (Television news), and it's probably why this show is only getting 6 episodes, and why the entire internet hate-watches this show, and shakes it's head for how out of touch Sorkin has gotten.",0
479,"What if...??? As of right now, Aaron Sorkin's only upcoming project is his Untitled Steve Jobs project.

He writes 4 episodes worth of material, &amp; it airs in June 2017. 

Now, this could be done in 1 of 2 ways.

- Do what Olive Kitteridge did &amp; air the 1st 2 episodes back-to-back on Sunday June 4th, &amp; the 3rd &amp; 4th episodes air on Monday the 5th.

- Air it over 4 Sundays (most likely from June 4-25)

I definitely can't think of a positive outcome which would make me happy. Pruit just leaving/backing down because he feels guilty seems simplistic and out of character. ACN being sold to someone else seems like a cop out and science fiction. Everybody quitting in outrage and starting their own network is too fairytale-ish (although if anyone can make that work it's Sorkin).

So what? Are just gonna keep working under Pruit without changing anything? Because there isn't enough time left to make big changes.

Charlie then dies from the stress and Will is released for totally unrelated reasons involving the source. So the fact that the death and his release from jail occurred so close together looks to be an (un)lucky coincidence aka bad writing.

How would you think that TV segment on ACN would play out. How would the mob react?

Facts:

- the show makes it abundantly clear that the rape happened, the viewers are never asked to question that
- she admitted to drinking too much tequila and using every drug which was placed in front of her: molly, coke, shrooms
- not the police, nor the DA, nor the campus police (with preponderance of evidence) wanted to touch the case
- she puked and passed out
- she has no visible (for the viewer) bruises anywhere and doesn't mention a struggle 
- they took off her cloths so it is to be assumed that she wasn't in control of her body
- the rapists are rich
- the rapists stick to a different story, but come across as sleazy 

---

The interview on TV:

She will repeat her story. If she doesn't bring up the insane amount of drugs the other party or the interviewer will. Also her website will come up.

The rapists will be coached by media professionals (they have rich parents and money) so they will likely come across better than when they talked to Don. They are rapists, so they are morally bankrupt and will lie. Based on that their story will be something like that:

We found her in the bathroom. She looked fine to us, but since she puked we offered to bring her into a bedroom to rest for a bit. While walking there we asked her why she puked and she told us that she just had one drink and doesn't know. She was very lively and showed us she is sober by pretending we were officers trying to arrest her. She walked a straight line and touched her nose with her fingers - you know the usual. She was outgoing and fun, we had no idea that she was full of drugs. In the room she not only gave enthusiastic consent, she literally begged us to fuck her and bring more people in. She said she never had a threesome before and wanted to cross that off her college list.

505,"Finale Theory: The kid(s) at the end of Camelot. It really feels to me like Mac &amp; Charlie's vision for ACN dies with Charlie and the final episode sees the gang split up and go out into the world. As ACN has crumbled we've seen Maggie become more confident, capable and assertive throughout this season. She weathered the storm last season and is now on the level of Don, Jim and Sloan. In fact we've seen them all do morally courageous things this season.

With that in mind, I offer the theory that the junior staff are ALL the ""kid at the end of Camelot"" Will references at the end of season one. 

Wherever they go to out into the world once ACN rebrands or self-destructs during the course of the finale, they carry on the institutions ACN instilled in them, ultimately influencing future generations on how to do the news based on the teachings of Charlie, Will and Mac. Because they have lived through and been there for ""News Night 2.0"" and the mock debate and everything else, they are the ones most qualified to ""tell people that it's possible."" 

The legacy of Charlie and even Will and Mac ultimately lives on in Maggie, Jim, Don, Sloan and everyone else. As Will rides off into the sunset he can reflect on a job well done that there was not just one ""kid at the end of Camelot"" but a whole staff full of them.

Will does a final broadcast dedicated to Charlie. 

Sloan and Don bring him up to speed on everything that has transpired in the days he's been away. He meets with the Lansings at the funeral who agree to assist him (Either with inside info for the cause or using the time to find a way to distract Pruit whilst Newsnight run the final broadcast). In the same vein that he apologised for the way ACN had been going up until Mac got there, he addresses the new direction Newsnight has taken under new ownership, calls out the negligence of citizen journalism, public invasion, biased speculations from those unqualified etc etc. Full broadcast in a blaze of glory that gets them all fired, like Jesus in the temple with the merchants. I don't think they're ever going to 'Win One' until they're willing to give up everything, which they weren't willing to do with Genoa and giving up the Source. The new ACN is not what Leona and Charlie built, it's not what the news team built and I think it's safe to assume that the staff are dedicated to Will enough to go down with the ship if he called it quits. 

Bonus would be if another Newscorp would take on their show at the very end, but I think it would end with them turning the lights off and leave us to imagine their fates.

512,Interesting thoughts on the negative side of this season ,0
513,"Sorkin's obsession with what college people went to Another episode that brings up where people went to school.  I just don't get it.  And frankly, it feels elitist to a level that's not even accurate.  I went to a very old, very good school myself and I can tell you I don't bring it up all the time nor hang it over people's head.  And neither do the people I went to that school with.  I have no idea why he thinks the school people went to is so important to professionals when its half a lifetime ago.  The working world quickly teaches you to flush any collegiate pomp down the toilette and gain some real world skills and experience.  So nothing is more useless and shitty than someone who hangs their hat on what college they went to, especially if they are middle-aged.

And furthermore Sorkin continues to give this uber alles revelry to ivy league/British colleges.  You can get a comparable education at any number of state colleges like UC Berkeley, UVA, Michigan, the military academies; and their admission process doesn't factor in a bunch of legacy/donor under-the-table bullshit.  But still, in his shows someone has to go to a top university by old money standards and as soon as someone namedrops, the discussion goes cold as the other party submits in some ridiculous subordination to a name.

To put in perspective his over-emphasis on educational accolades over substance or reality, I began reading up on the big time anchors of today to see if they had such achievements.  Brian Williams didn't even finish college.  George Stephanopolous has a similar background to Will McAvoy but actually got his masters in theology as opposed to cliche law degree.  David Muir - bachelors degree from Ithaca College.  Scott Pelley - Texas Tech.  Wolf Blizter - University of Buffalo followed by Johns Hopkins.  So you get the picture.  Not only its Sorkin's obsession with the ivy league and where people went to school weird, its certainly not representative of where the upper echelon in the journalism field attended.  And I certainly didn't know where any of these anchors went to school nor does it now at all temper my opinion on their efficacy.  ",0

522,"A quick interpretation of tonight's big events [SPOILERS AHEAD] You've been warned.

So Charlie died. As devastating as it was, it's probably the most symbolic way he could have died. 

Charlie represents old school reporting from the days of Woodward and Bernstein, where immediacy wasn't quite superiority (being fast helped, but getting it right was the focus.) Then Pruett shows up. He's a millennial kid who thinks citizen journalism, reporting on celebrities and essentially cutting out fact-checking and other hallmarks of journalism will save it. 

When Charlie spends the entire episode telling his reporters to go along with it, he's taking on the role of the journalism industry. The changes he endured were such a shock that it ended his life, and Sorkin thinks current new journalism trends will kill off the industry that stands for reporting on the most important stories instead of celebrity bullshit.

I'm really sad to see him go and this episode's events certainly paint him as a tragic figure. But I'm struggling to find a better way to kill him off. It's one of the hits in this episode filled with either really strong writing (Don and the rape victim) and poorly-written work (Jim and Maggie.)

EDIT: how do names work?",0
523,"[Spoiler] A word about Aaron Sorkin Ok, let me start off by saying that Aaron Sorkin is my favourite writer for both TV and Film. In my opinion, the greatest words in the english language are ""Written By Aaron Sorkin"". However... He does have an air of predictability when it comes to certain things, the main one being evidenced in last nights episode.

If I where an actor being cast in an Aaron Sorkin series over the age of 50 and a friend/confidante to the main character, I wouldn't bother unpacking! So far, I cannot think of a single series where an older and usually wiser character hasn't at the very least had a life threatening medical problem, and at the worst, died!

In Sports Night, possibly the only excusable example of the bunch, they gave Isaac Jaffe a stroke that caused him to be absent for the second half of the first series and a distinct change in his outlook on life in the second season. I say this is excusable, as the only reason this was necessary was the actor who played him, the ever-talented Robert Guillaume, had a severe stroke midway through filming...

Next, we come to loveable Leo McGarry, President Bartlett's CoS and his best friend. Not only did working give this guy a heart attack and fire him, he then killed him off! Again, the death was only a part of the season due to John Spencers death in real life, but surely for a writer with the talents of Sorkin there could have been a work around that didn't involve me still sobbing uncontrollably when I watch this episode even to this day. (21 year old Male by the way).

And as if killing off the chief of staff wasn't enough, he had already taken the pen and ink to kill off my favourite minor character Sorkin has ever constructed, Mrs Landingham! I know that it was necessary motivation for the MS thing as well as running for office, but at the time I remember it just seeming senseless.

Then we come to the most throwaway health issue out of the four of them, firing Wes Mendel on day one of the series, and then six months later giving him a heart attack 6 years ago! We never particularly got to see his character in play, although it was quite clear that he was an important part of the lives of all of the main characters!

And finally, last night. Charlie Skinner was one of my favourite characters Sorkin had ever written. Funny, dry wit, old establishment with a compassion and lovability that shone through in some of the best character development I have ever seen in a series. And to see him almost make it to the final episode and die 60 minutes away from a happy life of being written and theorised about in the inevitable outpouring of ""what would they be doing now"" fan fiction is just heartbreaking. In some ways, sorkin is almost as impactful as a tragedy writer as he is a drama writer.

I love Aaron Sorkin's work, and if the tv websites are right and this is the end of the road for his TV writing career, I am glad to have been around for this.",0

Will got a name from Neal, but he thought the source was a male.

I'm going with his name (given to him by Neal, for purposes unknown) is fake. He realized this just before going into the grand jury.

He knows that Mackenzie knows the source personally, so now the only way he can expose the source is by pointing them to Mac. So he married her. Now, he (potentially, by the rules of TV) can't be compelled to incriminate her.

So he now has a legal basis to keep the source secret.

579,"Well, I think I ruined the finale for myself. [Spoiler] Well with the addition of Paul Lieberstein and B.J. Novak, I was interested in seeing if there was any more office guest stars, specifically ones who used to be producers/writers of the office.

My first instinct was to look on IMDB at the future episodes to see if I could spot any names. Huge mistake, because I came across this link.  

[This link contains indirect spoilers.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3680822/?ref_=tt_ep_nx)

So, on that page you can see there are mourners as names of some of the actors.  Well shit, someone is going to die in the last episode or episode before.

Then I see something that leads me to believe, the person I don't want to die, is going to die. The character the actress Audrey Rose is playing is ""Charlie's Daughter.""  

In the last episode, Charlie mentioned he spoke to his daughter.  This is the only thing that makes me hope, it could be Charlie's ex-wife that dies, but I personally believe it will be Charlie.

Any other evidence for it being Charlie who dies? Well I searched on google before I finally determined it was Charlie that would die and found this.

[Last Episode Synopsis](http://www.hypable.com/2014/11/19/the-newsroom-series-finale-synopsis-the-question-is-who/)

They mention the synopsis and it states that a death will effect Will and Mac.  It also mentions Neal, Leona, Pruit and Maggie are doing something, so they probably won't die.  They put up Charlie as their first guess too and while I don't agree that he will the one of the least heartbreaking, I agree with their prediction.

Fuck this, Charlie is my favorite. I'm an idiot.

580,"How The Newsroom Ends (Spoiler Alert!) Jim and Hallie sit in silence in a booth at Hang Chew's. On a television above them, Sloan's show is on, and she is reporting that someone has bought Continental Corp for some ridiculous sum. At the same time, a stock graph for NYSE: SIA appears showing a marked increase in share price. Jim admits he was a dick and apologizes to Hallie, but then starts to recant when he gets a push notification from his phone w/ her article -- a takedown piece on the still-a-fugitive Neal and the leaked government documents. It gets 1.6 millions page views. Hallie tells Jim thanks for everything, but she's got her prize piece and a book deal now. After taking a moment to reassure Jim that he was adequate in bed, Hallie get up and walks off. 

Jim slumps in his seat, devastated, as a mysterious stranger sitting in the booth behind him turns to him and says ""Your friend is going to be fine."" Jim asks how the stranger knows, to which he replies ""I just know. I always just know"", and gets up to leave. A beat later, and another push notification on Jim's phone. ACN reports that the source has come clean and has taken full responsibility. Jim turns around looking puzzled -- who was that mysterious man?

Cut to AWM boardroom. Just as Lucas Pruit's bid for AWM is about to go through, Calvin Trager walks into the board room to announce that Quo Vadimus has just completed a hostile takeover of Savannah Capital and is buying AWM after all, paying off the Lansing Twins for a full $1/share over what Pruitt offered. He gruffly announces that ""Anyone who can't make money off of News Night should get out of the money making business."" and then pointedly stares at the camera for about 10 seconds in silence. Blair looks bitchy and hot and says something about not caring as long as she gets hers before passionately kissing Pruit. Leona and Charlie are so elated that they initiate crazy old drunk sex on the boardroom carpet (off-camera) while Will and Mackenzie have a staring contest that may never end. Don rushes in, tripping over the old fornicators with Sloan walking right in behind him. They say that they don't care what happens to their jobs, but they need to get married right away. Randy happens to be an ordained minister (from the Internet, but who cares) and notary, so Sloan and Don have a quickie wedding followed by a high five and also begin rolling around the boardroom floor in orgiastic glee. Jim and Maggie walk into the room and look at each other, shrug their shoulders in resignation and drop to the floor as well. Rebecca Halliday just stands over all of them observing the scene, looking smoky. Newly-exonerated Neal walks into the room, tripping over Don and Sloan, and cluelessly says ""What did I miss?"" Everyone immediately stops to hug him. Will, Jim, and Don decide to carry Neal into the Newsroom, Rudy-style. 

We follow our gang through the newsroom, where everyone stands and cheers. Red news alerts are going off like crazy and Eliot is on the air trying to give a report about Mohammed Morsi, but no one gives a shit. Charlie throws Gary Cooper a key and tells him to open the bottom drawer on the right side of his desk. Gary says ""I thought that thing was broken"" when he unlocks it and finds rolls of old ticker tape.  Charlie yells from across the room ""I've been saving it for a special occasion!"" and suddenly ticker tape is flying around the newsroom. Intern Jenna drops a tray of coffee. 

Trager walks into an elevator and observes the pandemonium with a calm look on his face as the doors close. 

Trager stands on the roof of the AWM building, looking out for the Bus, which lands just in time. The hatch opens and we see a cane, followed by feet. Nick Fury walks out onto the roof and looks around, announcing ""mmm mmm! I just love it when white people have a happy ending!"" Staring out into the New York skyline, we see the nearly-finished Freedom Tower where the CSC letters are being replaced by a logo for Stark International.

I think its lacking in character diversity. I think the story is sometimes just silly with the amount and magnitude of mistakes made. I think the romance story lines are questionable. But overall its clearly a quality show with amazing dialogue, and is an entertaining, intellectually stimulating watch. There's some excellent and topical political commentary as well.

But I came on reddit to see what people thought and the criticism has been atrocious. Ive seen complaints that the dialogue is not realistic. Really? The dialogue on a television show being ""unrealistic"" is a legitimate criticism? Ive seen people complain that the female characters are poorly constructed and stupid. Aside from Maggie, I have liked the female characters on the show more than almost any other show. They aren't shown as being beneath men, or less intelligent than men in any way. I feel like there is real equality in terms of the importance, intellect, and input of the female characters. 

Does the show get soap boxy? Well yeah, and that's a legitimate complaint, but I didn't find it nearly as pretentious as the majority of people seem to.

The writers could've probably picked a different school and maintained factual accuracy.

This has never happened in the U.S. before, so it will be major news, it will dominate not just the news, but also political discussions.

This will cause ACN’s ratings to go through the roof.

629,"[Spoilers] Neal's legal situation post Boston Season 3 Episode 1 regarding Neals legal problem...

Neal is being set up.
Season 2 Episode 5, Charlie has a meeting with his 'source'.
Charlie calls him 'Shep' in their meeting, and we learn that he is a 'spy' that works for ONI, the Office of Naval Intelligence.
Shep gives charlie the document that we come to know as the helicopter manifest in the Genoa story, which supposedly has reference to the sarin gas, but is really a secret personal note to Charlie that says ""fuck you"".

In the conclusion of the Genoa story, Red team III, Charlie goes to meet Shep in a parking garage. Shep reveals that he set Charlie up with the manifest because he blames Charlie for the death of his son. The only other person Shep mentions by name in that conversation is Neal. He blames Neal and Charlie equally for his sons suicide because Neal fired David (Shep's son). He also states he is confused by the medias fascination with the number 3, ""3 days 3 months 3 years""

The email message Neal gets tells him to up his encryption to be able to handle 3 trillion (tri=3) guesses per second. He receives about 27,000 documents (30x30x30, or 30^3=27,000). 27000 divided by 90 days (the total number of days David worked for ACN)=300 documents a day. (lots of 3's)

It would make sense that the situation Neal finds himself in now, with the stolen documents, has been set up by Shep to lure him into doing something illegal, which he can then be arrested for. It's entrapment if the Newsroom can prove it, but right now it looks like they haven't figured out what is going on. 

BTW the USB key that Neal gets was hidden in a toilet in a steak house in NYC. This is obviously a Godfather reference. Michael Corleone gets a gun from a toilet and then is forced into hiding in Italy for several years after the killing. Neal enters the bathroom, and there is a man at the sink. When the man looks over at Neal he smiles, then looks down, wipes his hands, and leaves the bathroom.
The man in the bathroom is the one who left the USB key.

The Newsroom need to realize, and then find a way to prove that Shep leaked the documents. 
They really have no choice but to do it on their own. They could go to the FBI, but there is a risk that ONI has people there too. Although they may cooperate with some federal agency to smoke out the leek. Im not sure which direction they will go.
So Neals current storyline is sort of a continuation of the Genoa storyline.

If the team can root out Shep as the leak, they could then go public with the fact that they were set up on Genoa from the beginning over a personal grievance. This would restore their credibility, and renew their reputation with the government sources they currently have but are unable to use because of Genoa.

At the end of season 3 episode 1, Neal describes the secret documents he received. He says BCD is a contractor for SOCOM that places stories in foreign press about US soldiers doing community outreach in addition propaganda to help our foreign policy. This happens to be exactly what Maggie ended up doing in Africa, though she never completes that story as far as we know.

So it is also possible that Shep is the one that OK's Maggie's trip to Africa, knowing she was being sent in to a dangerous area, maybe even intentionally trying to get her and Gary killed, though I am not sure why at this point, other than to continue to fuck with Charlie.

630,I could not stop laughing at this little moment. I think it's the way Charlie's standing on one leg. ,0
631,"[Spoiler](/s ""Damnit, I think I understand ""The Newsroom"", the way Sorkin wanted to portray it. Read if you want spoilers"") I think The Newsroom was supposed to be about a character exploration of Will McAvoy and we took it to be an idealistic statement about the way a Newsroom ought to be run. 

Think about it, the whole series thus far we've been getting crippling insights about Will McAvoys character, and his innermost frailty and the best we got from everyone else is a supporting evidence or comedic relief. 

I think Sorkin wanted to explore a frail old-middle aged man who is Highly Intelligent and has the ego of someone who is Highly Intelligent (Intellectual pissing contests are a constant) takes up the beliefs of those around him just to be liked by them. And when he inevitably gets bit in the ass he is unable to take it, because he never believed truly in them, and he takes it as an attack on his character, and not his ideas. 


* Why he couldn't handle it when Mac Cheated on him.
* He's a Republican because he's a Nebraskan. And not because he espouses the ideas of the Party in it's current state.
* He takes it personally to oversee the well being of his staff even though he has no obligation to --&gt; circling back to protecting his siblings from his drunk dad (the therapist laid this out for us)
* He's in a Newsroom with Idealists who have defined what ""good"" new's is, and now that he has Mac back he's questioning if he agree's with what is ""good"" is (Ep 1 of Season 3 is basically this in the beginning)
* He's fighting with everyone to prove how smart he is rather than showing he gets the idea that everyone is talking about. And the sad inherent thing is he's friggin intelligent (saw the whole FBI thing coming a mile away, and while he's in the room he's fighting with the lawyer to prove he's a better lawyer --&gt; when in reality he told Neil to call her rather than personally representing Neil, because the foresaw there was going to be a time when he's going to need to shelter Neil from the consequences and he can't do that as his lawyer)

What Sorkin is doing this Season is burning down the amazing context he placed Will McAvoy (AKA his Newsroom and the amazing people in it), until all we have left is just a beaten down Will in the corner. And it's going to become brutally obvious that The Newsroom is about Will McAvoy and not his ideas. 

* The trailer when Charlie said he's doing all of this for Mac. (showing he doesn't have the same idealistic belief as everyone else)
* Charlie is a father figure he never had and he constantly craves his opinion. 
* The Don Quijote metaphor. We took it as everyone who was in The Newsroom is Don Quijote for being outlaw News figures. But Will still thinks he alone is Don Quijote. ",0

641,"It is REESE Lansing. Also, character discussion. His named is spelled Reese, not any other of these ways y'all are throwing out.  This is the official spelling.  (Well, official according to the Wikipedia page for The Newsroom)

Let's talk about his character for a minute, though.

First of all I'm gonna be a bit biased because I love Chris Messina and I think he's devastatingly sexy.  However, I've always thought Reese was a great character.  They've used him previously as an antagonist- being one of the ""suits"", but in reality he's a guy trying to do his job the same way that the team at ACN is doing theirs.

I can tell by this season that they're really going to be humanizing him though and making him look more and more like a protagonist.

642,Charlie Skinner Character Discussion So I generally think this is one of the best shows on TV but one thing has always bothered me. I've never like Sam Waterson as Charlie.

645,"Sorkin speaking to us through Will in s3e01 So I caught onto a subtle theme running through the first episode (I know, just one?) and I wanted to air it out here, see if it sticks.

First, I want to reference [this post from /r/thewestwing,](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/2lv58x/filling_the_gap/) which talks about Sorkins motivations for writing the series *Studio 60*, and how he used his personal life to influence the story. It's a good read.

Anyway, there are a few lines in the show that caught my attention. First is in the first few minutes of the show, after Will fails to deliver a rousing speech. Talking to Charlie, Will says ""Why wasn't I able to put my finger on what we're talking about""? ""Because it's obvious"" replies Charlie.

Later, when speaking to Mac about keeping current with the other networks, Will says ""I'm still trying to figure out what doing well means"". Mac replies ""you know what it means"".

I think that Sorkin is lamenting on the current state of this show, and the defeatist attitude he has towards his latest attempt at high-brow television. It's clear that he loves this show, and that he took the negative reviews personally enough to kill the show in only 6 episodes. He know's what good television looks like, and he knows that this show is it. But he doesn't understand why nobody else can see that.

What do you guys think?",0

So far I'm 5 episodes in and loving every minute, but I have one quick question: Why does Don Keefer continue to be around so much, I assumed that once the 'transition' was complete, he would be in another newsroom for the 10 o'clock show. Or do the two shows share a newsroom (the 10 shows and Will's show)? 

On the same token, do the background staff (excluding the producers)  work on all the network's show? Or do they just work on say Will's, or the 10 o'clock show.

by Robert Herrick

/

GATHER ye rosebuds while ye may,

Old Time is still a-flying:

And this same flower that smiles to-day

To-morrow will be dying.

/

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,

The higher he 's a-getting,

The sooner will his race be run,

And nearer he's to setting.

/

That age is best which is the first,

When youth and blood are warmer;

But being spent, the worse, and worst

Times still succeed the former.

/

Then be not coy, but use your time,

And while ye may, go marry:

For having lost but once your prime,

You may forever tarry.",0

I currently belong to a lot of different show subreddits (mainly /r/BreakingBad, /r/SonsofAnarchy, /r/Lost, /r/Madmen, and /r/TWD), and I have to admit that this one is at times my least favorite to post to. In my opinion, what truly makes show subreddits great is the discussion that revolves around the show. What worked, what didn't, what we liked, and what we didn't. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be the same here.

It seems that in order to be heard on this subreddit, you must truly love the show and never say anything bad about it. This has become very obvious during the last few episodes, as those who post anything critical about the show are downvoted into obscurity and rarely acknowledged by one or two individuals who truly seem interested in discussing the merits of the show. 

We as a community have a chance to shape this place. Would we rather discuss the show that we all enjoy despite all of its faults, or would we rather just talk about how awesome it is and how infallible Sorkin and the cast are? It is our choice.

I will no doubt catch some flak and be seen as just some bleeding heart who wants everyone to get along, blah blah blah he just wants karma, etc. The truth is, I would just rather come to this subreddit for honest discussion and critique rather than mindless ""OMG SLOANE AND DON 4EVER!"" posts. The downvote is used here as a way to show that you disagree with someone rather than an actual post, and that only hurts the overall discussion and by extension the subreddit as a whole. I could care less about my karma, I care about the product that comes from this subreddit.

Just something to think about. It's a long time until season 3, and if this subpar content continues until then, this subreddit likely won't make it. ",0

A good one-liner, but obviously not nearly enough to satisfy many critics of the show whining about Sorkin's liberal bias.

Finally, in the season 2 finale, Will expands on this a lot more after asking Taylor to take him apart.  I thought his monologue in this episode had a lot more substance and less ""zing"" than past references to his political stance.  And in the same scene, he's defending not only his own beliefs, but also ACN's strategy in covering the news, and by proxy, the so-called ""liberal media"".

Do I think it will shut the critics up?  Of course not, but I do finally feel that this subject got the treatment it deserves on the show.

""Dan Rather-ed"" is, of course, a reference to [a real-life Genoa-like situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killian_documents_controversy).

1. Solomon Handcock. This will probably be part of season 3 if they report on Edward Snowden.

2. Trolls and death threats. Are the threats real? Will the people responsible caught? Again, they could connect this with Anonymous in season 3.

3. TMI and Reese. Did they shut down TMI? Did Reese donate any money to a school? I would be fun to see TMI go online only, ala ""Newsweek"", after it's disclosed to Leona that the print version has been losing money for months.

4. Jennifer Johnson. What happened to her after the incident at North Western? Did she have to sign anything to prevent her from suing Will or AWM before she could be an intern? It wouldn't have been a big issue but lawyers don't like loose ends.

5. Did Gary ever take protection money when he worked at TMI? Did he ever witness it directly or was it just office gossip? Not that I want another lawsuit story but it would be interesting to see his character get into trouble for his past indiscretions.

Just a few and all I can think of right now. I've added my own ideas about TMI, North Western and Gary. Add more plot points that are missing endings, make up your own based on season 1 or tell me how I'm wrong and/or an idiot. Either way, post below.",0

915,"The origin of the name ""Red Team"" - odd Sorkin mistake I guess I've gotten used to Sorkin being pretty good at his own fact checking. Sure he makes mistakes but this one is really bizarre. 

I'll caveat by saying that I'm not a journalist, but I feel pretty confident on this.

In ""Red Team III"" (S02E07) the origin of the term ""Red Team"" is explained as representing ""the red blood cells that clean up after white blood cells do their work""

At which point my head exploded, because it's such an incredibly contrived idea. 

Anyone who's been anywhere even *close* to the military can tell you that a ""red team"" is when you get your own people to represent the enemy to test your own tactics. It's from the Cold War, when the only opponent we had were the Soviets. The term is so pervasive through three decades of military strategy that *I* am aware of that at no point did it enter my mind this season that ""Red Team"" meant anything but ""we set up an opposition team of our own people to attack our story""

Hrm. 

When I was writing this, I was going to comment that if the opfor concept started today, they'd probably represent China and be called a ""Yellow Team"" except that's not PC, so they'd probably call them something else. 

Now I'm wondering if Sorkin knew the military called them ""Red Teams"" but not the origin, so he contacted a military guy to ask the question. And then I surmised that, in light of modern PCism, maybe the *military* gives this explanation of the origin of the term nowadays to avoid saying that our opposition forces are still named after the Soviets. 

Still seems kinda odd that Sorkin didn't just know the origin of the term, though. 

Sorry for the meandering - thinking this through as I type. Just not used to massive screaming errors like that in Sorkin's work. ",0

919,"Now that the Genoa plot has culminated, how will the rest of the show play out? During this whole second season I've been yearning for a show more like what we saw during season one. 

I think the conditions are perfect for this change. We've been on a hiatus from doing real news and breaking stories, and the ACN crew has to win back the audience's trust. The show will return to doing what it was meant to do, and the characters can stop being exhausted, worried, and anxious (a la Maggie, Jim, Charlie).

I think this Genoa plot was a great idea. It really brought in the characters to have us learn what they are like and how they act; something we wouldn't get from the former style of the show. 

I also think that Genoa was strategically placed in an dry area of news. If I'm correct, the date of the show currently is September 2012. Edward Snowden's NSA leak happens in late 2012.

After nearly 26 years in elected office, this past nightmarish month and a half have, for the first time, severed the necessary harmony between the needs of my constituency and of my family. As this harmony is required to serve, its absence requires I leave.

The recent event’s totality of calumnies, indignities and deceits have weighed most heavily upon my family. Thus, acutely aware one cannot rebuild their hearth of home amongst the ruins of their U.S. House office, for the sake of my loved ones I must “strike another match, go start anew” by embracing the promotion back from public servant to sovereign citizen.

I do not leave for an existing job and face diminishing prospects (and am both unwilling and ill-suited to lobby), my priorities are twofold: find gainful employment to help provide for my family; and continue to assist, in any way they see fit, the Michigan Attorney General’s earnest and thorough investigation, which I requested, into the 2012 petition filing.

While our family takes this step into the rest of our lives, we do so with the ultimate confidence in our country’s future. True, as at other times in the life of our nation, we live in an Age of Extremes that prizes intensity over sanity; rhetoric over reality; and destruction over creation. But this too shall pass, thanks to the infinite, inspired wisdom of the sovereign people who, with God’s continued blessings, will again affirm for the generations American Exceptionalism.

Truly, it is a challenging and fortunate time to live in our blessed sanctuary of liberty.

In closing, to The People of Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, I can but say this: Thank you for the privilege of having worked for you.”

Years ago I started a little passion project of trying to reconstruct a floor plan of the set of The West Wing from screencaps I took off the DVD special feature tour of the set. A recent rewatch of the series sparked my drive to start working on cleaning it up some more in Photoshop and adding to it. The set was built with doors galore and lots of extra space that could get used for future changes, and it's fun to see different little areas appear and evolve throughout the series. The most obvious is the creation of a whole press bullpen area for season 5, but there's other interesting things like the fact that they finally showed where at least one bathroom is in season 5, too. I just wanted to share my progress and maybe start some interesting conversations about what the reddit WW community thinks of the way the set evolved over the years.

What should I watch next? I need something to satisfy my need for a top-quality political drama. 

I've seen House of Cards and thought that was good (especially early seasons) in a very different way obviously. 

Considering:

1. Designated Survivor - saw a few episodes on ABC early on and thought the writing wasn't great.  Does it get better?

2. Scandal - haven't seen a minute of it. Is it too much soap opera?

Any other suggestions?",1

I will preface this by saying I am a die hard fan of the show and have watched it back to front many times. Recently I realized that the last couple times I did a real rewatch I stopped after season 4 because I dreaded the second half of the show so much. In an attempt to reinvigorate myself on seasons 5-7 I decided to start this round ON season 5. 

It’s been a revelation. I honestly am really enjoying it. I think I was so attached to the core team that I just couldn’t accept seeing others on the screen. And the schism between Josh and Toby always depressed me. Don’t get me wrong, still hate that plot point, but I can appreciate the device it is a little more this time. And I really enjoy watching Santos and Vinick. I think they are great characters and are each acted extremely well. I also love seeing Donna and Josh finally get
together.

58,"Reflecting on the impact this show had on me, particularly President Bartlet and Leo. I’m 46, a former Republican, now progressive. I know characters are an amalgamation of writing, performance, editing etc.  But like many, when I see Martin Sheen I see President Bartlet.  Martin Sheen and John Spencer left an indelible mark on me as those two characters. Somehow I felt so comfortable with them that I would see them in my dreams on occasion. Somehow we’d have already met and quickly fell into pleasant conversation. 

I credit the show with a change in my view of government. One where positive change could be effected even if only in small steps. I later went on to live in Denmark and saw firsthand what a government can be like that regularly strives to improve life for all of its citizens.  

In these days it could easily be dismissed as a pipe dream but it doesn’t have to be. If we choose to fight for the better version of ourselves and push for a better version of this country it _is_ possible to make things actually better. Not just better for some, not just a temporary superficial better but one grounded in our most fundamental values like the golden rule. There are plenty of bad actors prepared to create and maintain a lopsided version of “good” but I firmly believe there are more of us who want to see a better future for all.  

Watching the video that was just released featuring several celebrities including Martin Sheen reminded me not the let my anger get the better of me. Leading me into a smoldering stupor.  It reminded me to keep my eyes clear, support this vision of the future in every way I can and not succumb to the cynicism of the age that tells us real change, real justice are fairytales.

Please forgive me if I'm asking a stupid question, or maybe I'm just bad at subtext, but sometimes with this show and many Sorkin shows, there's a lot in the subtext.

Gibson have gone ahead and leaked the story (of Leo's getting soused on the night of the last debate) anyway?  I know the real answer is that it would have been inconsistent with the plot directions the writers wanted to go, but it just seems unrealistic to me.  The portrayal of Gibson up to that point makes it almost certain in my mind that he would have disclosed, the deal notwithstanding.

I have heard a lot of people discussing the idea that the reboot could be focused on a Seaborn Administration, bringing the chess game between Sam and President Bartlet in “Hartsfield’s Landing” full circle.  I think this has the possibility of being a great reboot. 

But...what about Charlie? He was planning on going to law school at Georgetown when the series ended. He would now be in his 40’s. My guess is Charlie would have gone back into public service at some point. 

Could the rebooted series feature Charlie as a young, dynamic mayor of DC trying to make an unlikely run at the White House ala Mayor Pete? 

I know that Charlie was beloved by most West Wing fans (including me). The idea of Charlie’s story going from the President’s body man to the actual President would be pretty exciting. Just a thought. I would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on the possible reboot! Thanks for reading.",1

&amp;#x200B;

I had made several years ago this little compilation video that I called ""the road to the Santos White House"" picking out a few of the most key scenes during seasons 6 and 7 that highlighted the start to finish on Matt Santos becoming the new POTUS at the end of the series. It was about 15 minutes long but because how many channel was as the time, I had to split it into 2 parts. And they got a fair amount of views over the years but for the last 18 months or so I'd had this itch to completely remake it, but going quite a bit deeper. Though even being almost an hour long, I could have it in one neat, contained video. I'm happy enough with how the final cut came out, but Youtube wouldn't even let me upload it, for surely obvious reasons. I don't know how these channels that primarily feature fan edited compilations with tons of TV show or film footage are able to last on there. The last few times I've tried something, it gets flagged immediately. Anyway, this is why I'm presenting this now from my Vimeo page, as much as I would've preferred Youtube. They're far more lenient, but obviously not nearly as popular.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the revamping of this whole concept I wanted to do it in a way similar in size to what would've been a West Wing episode itself, of course a wee bit longer hahaa... more like an episode length from a cable series.

The thing that sticks out, and what I want the example of, is that these two douchebags were so full of themselves that they were adjusting the menu in the most conceited ways possible.  Here they were at a VERY nice restaurant, obviously led by extremely capable chefs, and they both had to make a big show of how they knew better than the chef how to make their dishes.

I was on autopilot this morning as I was backgrounding the end of season 3 in my annual rewatch. Naturally, “Posse Comitatus” made me tune back in, but then s4 started up, and I wasn’t thinking carefully about what was about to happen. So, again, I was pleasantly surprised.

In know many people cite “Two Cathedrals” and some others as their favorite episodes, and for good reason, but I wanted to state my love for “20 Hours in America.” Taken together, Parts 1 and 2 are a brilliant play by Sorkin, featuring amazing profiles of so many of the cast in some of their finest moments. Especially great profiles are shown for Charlie, Debbie, C.J., and Donna; but for me it’s always Sam. Schmutzy Pants is my guy, and this two-parter is my favorite West Wing watch—outshining even ""Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail"" for peak Seaborn.

* *17 People.* Toby confronting Leo about Hoynes' poll. The sound of the ball bouncing. The slow push-ins. That final ""What's going on, Leo?"" And the thundering sound of the ball. When the titles come, it's like we've just lit the fuse on the final leg of the season.
* *What Kind Of Day Has It Been.* Gina taking stock of the crowd at Rosslyn, noticing something's amiss, trying to figure it out, and then just as she spots something the music swells and BOOM, the titles. 
* *In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen Part I.* The natural companion to WKODHIB. Josh falling limply into Toby's hands gives me chills. The titles seem way too upbeat by contrast, which makes it all the more disturbing.
* *Election Night.* ""Any idea if you need to be, I don't know, pre-registered?"" (Long beat.) ""YES!!!!!!!""",1

I'm personally in favor of a new cast, because the story of the last one was pretty well wrapped up, and as great as the show is, and it is great, it was more designed for the Clinton-era and its aftermath. I think a new administration will allow the show to be designed for the modern era, and you can have the original cast members occasionally making significant cameos.",1

So, one of the main reasons (other then their ability to, you know, talk about their feelings) that Josh and Donna don’t get together earlier, according to them, is that it would be inappropriate for Josh to date his assistant and it is implied it would cause all sorts of press issues.

That's some alarming behavior right there, and I'd recommend they both go see a therapist IRL. The only thing I appreciate about the Amy character is that she is such a stark contrast to Donna that she helps the viewers (me, at least) realize how much better Donna is for Josh.

I am halfway through season 6 but have gone ahead and spoiled myself to learn that Josh and Donna don’t get together until midway through season 7.  

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve enjoyed the slow burn. But I do find it rather puzzling that throughout the length of the show they have these big moments of almost admitting or realizing their feelings for each other only for there to be another season long stretch of little to no movement for them. It seems a bit excessive and frustrating at times. 

I can understand not wanting to pull the trigger on them too early, but waiting until the last half of the final (SEVEN) season seems almost unfairly rushed for the sake of wrapping the show up.

270,"The West Wing easter egg that I so wish WAS one but couldn't possibly actually BE one Alright folks, I'm putting my West Wing nerd-level to a bit of a test here lol... (&amp; btw, my background Twitter pic has always been the group shot from the s7 premiere of them standing outside the Bartlet library). I got an inch a few weeks ago to revisit the season 4 episodes surrounding the reelection. In 04x07 *Election Night*, Sam is making his first confession to another staff member (Donna) about the offer he made to Will Bailey that he'd be the Democrat to run should the utter impossibility of the deceased Horton Wilde winning the main election happen.

&amp;#x200B;

He says to Donna, *""This wasn't going to cost me anything. They weren't gonna announce unless Wilde won, and that was never gonna happen in Orange County. It's like the Secretary Of Agriculture saying 'Sure, I'm ready to assume the Presidency, should the 18 who come before me DIE'. So why not?""*

&amp;#x200B;

It kinda stuck in my head for a little bit that that number seemed a little familiar to something. Then it hit me. In the absolutely legendary episode 02x18 *17 People*, after Toby's finally been given the whole story about Bartlet's MS diagnosis, he points out that the number of people who were already aware being 16 wasn't strictly accurate, that Bartlet himself knew. Making it 17 people. Which, of course, would make one Mr. Toby Ziegler the 18th person to know. (and there's the added little kicker that the episode itself was the 18th of the season)

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as that kicked in, I had this ""oh my god that's too perfect"" moment, followed all of about 7 seconds later by ""okay moron, be real, that is WAY too friggin obscure of a thing that someone did that on purpose"" lol  Still, I love to think that Aaron Sorkin when he was writing this, knew he could just pick a totally random number to make Sam's line work, and somehow the synapses fired just right to make THAT be the reason he picked 18 :)",1

281,"I convinced my mom to rewatch the west wing with me She watched it when it aired but hardly remembers anything, and since she’s been spending a lot of time watching politics and complaining, I figured it would be a good idea for her to escape that for a little bit. I managed to convince her by bringing up Lawrence O’ Donnell, (since she watches his segment a lot) by saying he produced/wrote some episodes and played Bartlet’s abusive dad. 

Best decision I made. I can now watch and discuss it with someone and I love watching her reactions to the dialogue/plots because it’s like the first time watching for her. We ended up watching the first 5 episodes! (I thought she’d only wanna watch 1 or 2, but at the end of each episode she said “one more!”) She laughed a lot and said it was how she remembers in terms of quality writing. She was also shocked at how tall Allison Janney was and that Bartlet’s full name was Josiah. 😂

""It was not a space ship from another planet, just another time. A long since abandoned Soviet satellite. One of its booster rockets didn't fire and it couldn't escape Earth's orbit. A sad reminder of a time when two powerful nations challenged each other and then boldly raced into outer space. What will be the next thing that challenges us, Toby? That makes us go farther and work harder? Do you know that when smallpox was eradicated, it was considered the single greatest humanitarian achievement of this century? Surely we can do it again, as we did in the times when our eyes looked towards the heavens and, with outstretched fingers, we touched the face of God. Here's to absent friends and the ones that are here now.""

Fitwallace mentions that women are giving birth to bombs does he mean that they are suicide bombers who pass off being pregnant to hide a bomb or does he mean that the children the women are giving birth to are growing up radicalised?

In the 1970s, Richie Cunningham’s brother Chuck (Happy Days) ascended the stairway to Mandyville. I like to think of him as the wise grandpa there. 

In the 90s, NYPD Blue sent Laura Kelly there after the first season. After the 3rd, Detective Lesniak was banished.

We're flying in a Lockheed Eagle series L1011. It came off the line 20 months ago. It carries a Sim-5 Transponder tracking system. Are you telling me I can still flummox this thing with something I bought at Radio Shack?

I love The West Wing. I started watching it due to my interest in geopolitics. I watched Newsroom before this. Loved its screenplay and dialogue. And then learnt, Sorkin, the creator excels at workplace dramas. And then I found TWW. It's my all time favorite show. I have atleast watched it 3 times in full. And watch few YouTube videos from time to time. It's kind of a solace for me these days whenever I listen to the news. Haha.

So, I started observing this behavior of mine few weeks ago. I would play a random YouTube video. Before the character says it, I will say it, almost with the same intonation. This is madness!  

Some of my friends know about my love for TWW. So, I pinged few of them and also shared this behavior of mine. Now, sharing with fellow TWW fans. Do any of you have any similar behavior? I don't really care for it but I never thought I will be passionate about anything this seriously. Haha

Now, I am like 99% certain that Leo is specifically talking about his alcohol problem, but he was a Vietnam pilot who saw action and bombed targets (one that we learn could be construed as a war crime).

They really weren’t useful during the campaign and were honestly just bringing down the campaign. From taking Santos education plan to coordinating with the grand jury instead of calling for a special prosecutor. Just seemed like a whole lot of shit for him to have called them out on. Not to mention when he brings Vinnick with him after the nuclear power plant incident even though he’s the republican nominee and could’ve potentially wiped out the chances of santos winning had the press not found out about vinnick pushing for the plant. It all just seemed like bartlet didn’t think santos could win and didn’t even bother to try helping in any way he could.

Josh was right in threatening to criticize the White House when they dealt away the education plan. He should’ve recommended to santos to do that, he would’ve separated himself from the bartlet administration and wouldn’t have been asked questions when the security leak situation came to be.

3. ""First row, first seat on your right"" &lt;---CJ is adamant that the president needs a softball question about his health when it's already been stated that ""it's answer B"" (Which we would assume the interviewer would have asked about)

It's Jordan who sees all along that a centure is the best course of action for the White House and is relentless in getting that across to her client.

355,"So like am I the only one who’s HATES Will and Donna during seasons 6-7??? So personally, I liked the characters for a big amount of time until 1.) Will got hired by the VP 2.) Donna joined the VP campaign. Here’s why:

- Will just seemed like such a pain in the ass, for example during Bartlet’s trip to China during 6x09 and 6x10. The president has an MS episode and while there are already physicians etc lined up to speak to the press, Will takes this as a time to make sure the VP gives a statement and the damn VP goes along with it and just to stick the knife in further, Russell uses that damn line about playing tennis when he heard the news, it just seemed to me that neither Russell nor Will had any type of respect for the president or the country since this clearly was a campaign stunt for them. Another instance was when during the SAME episode, they tried holding a damn cabinet meeting where they clearly were going to try and invoke the 25th amendment on Bartlet. That just showed so much disrespect and left a sour taste in my mouth.

- Another instance was when baker visited the White House and Will inserted Russell into the photo op to avoid it only being Bartlet and baker. Bartlet himself even told Russell never to do that again, he even said that he wasn’t choosing between either of them so it wasn’t even anything to do with the campaign just baker and the president taking a photo with some historic thing (I forgot what it was). Personally, I think Bartlet should’ve fired Will’s ass after that incident. It’s still his administration and still him governing till the final minute. 

- Donna really came off to me as annoying and full of herself when the New Hampshire primaries came around. She didn’t finish college and just expected a promotion to come her way because she worked in the White House under Josh for a long time. Will coming up to her with a job offer was definitely a little punch at Josh and Donna accepting was also a big backstab. She considered herself to be on Josh’s level of expertise just because Will gave her a job, she wasn’t even in charge of anything. I remember one quote from 6x11 where she says sarcastically “Yes, I let Will seduce me with a salary and actual political support” political support how?? Bingo bob had none lmao it’s why his ass was neck and neck with Santos at the convention. She’s literally just working on media targeting like come on. She makes it seem as if she’s on the same level now and tries to throw it all in Josh’s face. 

Another moment that really irritates me is when she tries to get a job at the santos campaign and she tries to dismiss the comments she made about santos during the campaign as “doing her job”. The quote that really pissed me off was her saying “You’re not used to seeing me in a position of power, I can see how that makes you uncomfortable.” It’s not even that, it’s the fact that she felt a little bit of power and instead of using it for good like Josh she used it to slander opponents and gain a few fractions in the polls. It put a smile on my face when josh didn’t even let her get past the interview stage. She Deserved every bit of that.

Final case: they’re both shitty characters in the end tbh. It kinda pissed me off that she ended up working for the campaign and santos administration in the end but oh well. The fact that Josh didn’t even ask Will to stay on was also pretty dope tbh. Sucks that he became a congressman later on, I feel that more than likely josh didn’t tell santos to help him out when he started campaigning. If he helped Russell more than likely he shared some views with the VP.

1) Every time I watch TWW it makes me want to be a better version of myself. It makes me want to be more informed, more educated, more articulate. No other show ever makes me feel the same way. However, on the flip side. 

2) The characters in the show really make me feel like shit about myself sometimes. I didn’t go to an Ivy League school, I didn’t score a 1590 on the SAT, and I don’t think I have the ability to work 18 hours a day like they seem to do in the show. 

I only wonder because if the characters in TWW are a reasonable representation of the type of people who work in the highest levels of anything then it makes me feel like there is definitely a ceiling on my capabilities and potential achievement. Anyone else feel this way?",1

366,"So I rewatched season 7’s last few episodes...Santo’s is such an ass**** The last season is passable, I enjoyed the whole campaign plot and what not. I just didn’t end up liking santos as much as I did when we first meet him in season 6. Here are a few reasons and ill try to cite certain episodes.

- He treats josh like a second thought even though this is the guy that pretty much got him to the fucking White House. For example in 7x09, we have a bunch of people recommending that josh be let go as campaign manager, and santos just takes it and doesn’t try to defend him at all. I think it’s BS that he ended up turning his back on him like that, I especially hated that he took Goodwin’s advice when Goodwin tried acting like an alley to josh earlier in that episode. (More on how much I hate Goodwin later.)

- Goodwin comes out of nowhere and honestly has no real connection to Santos during the campaign. Yet for whatever reason santo’s always seems to go along with Goodwin like when wanted to head the transition team he let him do it. Or when he wanted josh replaced by Leo as campaign manager, he once again willingly listened. I remember during the speaker race that josh wanted santo’s to remain neutral but santos kept mentioning how Goodwin thought he should throw his support behind his old pal. It just seems to me that santo’s didn’t feel as if he were in josh’s debt and that the only person that’s really looking out for him is josh.

Overall, it’s not surprising that so many AU’s have santos being a one term president tbh. He’s just so damn flip floppy when it comes to his own team especially josh and tbh if Goodwin was a part of his administration then that for sure concludes that his presidency would’ve been one term. He’s more willing to listen to anyone that he thinks has something important to say when really the only one who should be helping him out is his chief of staff which is josh.
Even he realizes that santos is looking for a yes man during the transition which I personally think is ridiculous.",1

371,"Favorite 'weaker' episodes 'Weaker' in quotes because so few of them are weak in any real way compared to anything else on tv, but I mean it more in the sense of 'we can't all be Two Cathedrals'. Are there any less critically acclaimed/generally beloved episodes that you have a soft spot for? Or episodes you think have significant flaws but like for random reasons you can't rationally defend? Or even widely disliked episodes you loved? My best friend just finished watching and put The Long Goodbye in her top 10, which.. surprised me to say the least lol but it got me wondering what other people's unconventional favs are.

I have a lot of them (pretty much the entire Santos primary/general election arc was top tier for me) but the one I love most intensely is Holy Night. It's by far my favorite holiday ep, and one of my favorite eps in general, even though I agree with the consensus that it's objectively (as objective as these things can be) the weakest holiday one of the Sorkin years, and the narrative's symmetry is pretty heavy handed. But Tobby is my favorite character, and I like Mafia stories, Yiddish and a cappella to a degree where when I was first watching it I was like 'wtf was this specifically designed to be my favorite episode'. I also love Santa Danny and the goldfish pin, and lol every time at 'I'm told that on my sunniest of days, I'm not that fun to be around. I wonder what's gonna happen when you make my children a part of your life'. 

Finally this exchange between Toby and Josh for me was one of the most moving of the entire show (and I don't say that lightly for this show):

&gt;\-It was desperation. It wasn't out of a desire to do evil. He had a young family and he barely spoke the language, and he went to jail. He went to jail, and you went to school, and it was all a half-century ago. Look what he did in two generations. What room did you just walk out of?  
&gt;  
&gt;\-I appreciate that that's what you think. Do I get to think what I think?   
&gt;  
&gt;\-No, you don't, cause you don't know what I know.   
&gt;  
&gt;\- What?   
&gt;  
&gt;\-That I would give anything to have a living father who was a felon. Or a sister with a past.

What about everyone else? This is a judgement-free zone for Mandy stans, Will+Kate shippers, and season 5.",1

373,"Be honest, how many times have you memorized and repeated TWW or Sorkin monologues in casual conversation to seem smart?

Toby: 

“I do know that if you combine the populations of Great Britain,
France, Germany,
Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Australia you've got a population
roughly the size
of the United States. We had 32,000 gun deaths last year and they had 112. Do

those guys have
gun control laws.”",1

381,"Shibboleth S2E8 Two highlights of the episode: 

1.) Bartlet giving Charlie the knife. I think it’s one of the most touching scenes in the series. He’s so fond of Charlie and thinks of him as a son (more than his son in law) so much so that he passes along his family knife. Add in that Charlie never had a father figure in his life and you have me in tears. 

2.) CJ growing attached to the turkeys and fighting to get the second one pardoned. 

And it just has some of my favorite quotes:

“We‘d prefer to watch football rather than listen to the history of the yam in Latin.”

“Troy, I want you to know it was neck and neck, but I’m giving it to Eric.”

“I chose Eric cause Troy doesn’t like to be touched which, surely, were not gonna execute him for.”

“Maybe after the ceremony you can get one of the forth graders to come in and show you how to use the intercom.” (I’m so not looking forward to the show w/o Mrs. Landingham) 

“I’m proud of you, Charlie.”

“They sent me two turkeys. The more photo friendly of the two gets a presidential pardon and a full life at a children’s zoo, the runner up gets eaten.”
“If the Oscars were like that, I’d watch.”

I'm well past season one but I was thinking about the finale of that season, and how it is later revealed that the assassination attempt was not aimed at the president, but at Charlie. Does this bother anyone else? Why would a group target him when he's with the president, one of the most well protected men in the world? Why not follow him home one day? If their main goal is to kill Charlie, why do it when he's surrounded by two hundred people?

Second, and the more important thing, is how empty the White House felt in the first season, in terms of background extras and how few higher level staff actually interacted with President 1 and Frank Underwood.

I am from the UK, and I have to say The West Wing doesn't really make it clear, and over in the UK the money for election things is not as big a thing as it is in America, because election cycles are TINY compared to elections cycles in America.

*I am not commenting on the actual policies of each candidate and this is Not meant to inspire political debate. I just think it would be fun to explore! 

Josh-  Pete Buttigieg.  I think it plays into his search for an underdog with promise. Buttigieg is a long shot but has so far been rather impressive in town halls.

Toby- Beto O’Rouke. Toby’s monologue to Josh about a candidate not needing to be “convinced” to run and feeling that they are destined for it! Based of O’Roukes recent Vanity Fair article.

Will- Biden. A safe bet and plays into the VP story line. 
 
CJ- Elizabeth Warren. Based off various opinions CJ has voiced through out the series, plus I would imagine she would prefer to support a female candidate.

468,"Am I alone in thinking Toby's arc makes sense? [SPOILERS] SPOILERS BELOW

I’ve seen many people deride the writers’ decisions for Toby in the last season or two. Richard Schiff was famously bitter for his character’s direction in the final seasons, claiming the writers didn’t understand Toby and wrote him as a “grump.” Some posit that the leak plot-line was meant as punishment for the actor’s demands and comments.

Everything I’ve seen from reddit users regarding Toby and the military shuttle leak share the same sentiment: Toby would never do that, I hate what they did with Toby, they didn’t understand Toby at all.

I am here to present a counter-argument. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the leak subplot, but I loved what they did with Toby and thought it made perfect sense.


First, Toby has always been ethically driven. Over the course of the series, he consistently proves his regard for moral obligations over direct orders. Nothing so drastic as the leak, but from the beginning, Toby is a warrior for righteousness, sometimes to a fault. I love Toby, and consider him one of my favorite characters for this reason. But when Bartlett accuses him of having always considered himself morally superior, I accepted that. I think that’s true.

So am I saying that season 1-3 Toby would have leaked the shuttle? Maybe, but probably not. However, he is not the same man by the time we get to season 7. Let’s look at Toby’s relationships over the course of the series.

When Sam leaves, Toby understands, but it doesn’t make it hurt any less. It was almost like getting a second divorce. His best friend, collaborator, and most trusted colleague left him.

~~At some point, his father dies, though my memory of the timing is foggy.~~

Then, Josh leaves for the Santos campaign, and doesn’t ask Toby to join him. We find out later that this wounded Toby deeply. Another colleague he respects and considers a close friend has vanished. 

Finally, his brother — the astronaut — commits suicide soon after being diagnosed with cancer (I don’t remember exactly where this falls, but it is before any of the leak stuff begins.) In this episode, he is clearly badly affected. It goes without saying that this has a profound and lasting impact on Toby, as it would any of us.
 

So ultimately, as I was watching, I understood S6-7 Toby to be someone who felt abandoned, alone, and beaten down. I think his sense of loyalty to the administration as a body was badly damaged.

So this is the Toby who leaks the shuttle information. A man, judgement skewed by his brother’s recent death, who considers the pursuit of the pure ethical choice to be paramount, greater than any loyalty, makes a decision. He then accepts the consequences, relinquishing neither CJ nor his brother’s reputation as bargaining chips.



I thought it was fantastic. And it added a realistic layer to the show by depriving a main character of a neat, happy ending. Eight years is a long time to spend in that environment. Relationships will fracture, people will change.

I, for one, am a Toby fan to the end.


EDIT: Father didn’t die, I just imagined that.",1

And then Danny comes and sits with Josh and you can see that both are sad about not getting any action. And I find that so funny, not so much the setup, it's mostly the acting that really makes it funny. It's probably my favorite low key humor moment in the entire show.

Are there any other moments like this? I love rewatching scenes like this. ",1

[C.J., Abbey, Amy, And Donna Back At The Party](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Ij9rl93FSFQ)

[*Donna walks up to them from behind.*]

DONNA: Mrs. Bartlet?

ABBEY: Yes?

DONNA: Excuse me, but I'm so sorry about the way I spoke before.

ABBEY: Oh, don't be. You were good. I've got a surprise for you coming up.

DONNA: Really?

JOSH APPROACHES: Donna, you're an American again! INS has a grandfather clause. If you pass a three-part literacy test, an American history exam, and fill out a one-page form, you're back.

DONNA: My adopted country.

ABBEY: Oh, Josh, I kind of wished you'd mentioned this before.

JOSH: Why?

[*Drumroll. Fanfare, suddenly The Canadian National Anthem begins.*]

 **”O, Canada.”**

DONNA: Wow.

[*Two Canadian flags are raised Donna watches in amazement.*]

ABBEY:  You were very good in there, Donna.

[*Behind them, Bartlet approaches with Charlie as O, Canada, we stand on guard for thee can be heard loudly*]

BARTLET: **WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!**

ABBEY: Shh.

BARTLET: I was only gone for 45 minutes. They were all Americans when I left.

DONNA:  **I know exactly how you feel, Mr. President.**

MILLGATE: No.

SAM:  Look, Congress isn't gonna fund your damn Superconductor, all right?

MILLGATE: Supercollider. Superconducting Supercollider. This is exactly what I'm talking about. A 54-mile tunnel, 150 feet below ground in which protons and antiprotons would be flung into each other at the speed of light. Can you remember that?

SAM: Yes.

MILLGATE: Good 'cause when you talk about it, you should sound like an idiot.

SAM: Okay.

SAM: Well, first of all, you're not allowed to smoke in the White House.

MILLGATE: You're kidding?

SAM: No.

MILLGATE: And the search for civilization continues.

SAM:  Come outside.  I need you to tell me everything you can tell me about the Superconducting Supercollider.

BARTLET: I could tell the story of the ditch digger.

CHARLIE: I do not.

BARTLET: Abbey and I were walking along and we see a ditch digger, and I said, ""Aren't you glad you married me? You could've married a ditch digger."" And she said, ""Jed, if I'd married him, he'd be President."" What do you think?

CHARLIE: Not so sure, sir.

BARTLET: Why?

BARTLET: And?

LEO: I don't think you need to be concerned about her leaving you for me.

BARTLET: I was pretty concerned about that.

LEO: She's definitely leaving you for somebody, so don't be so...

Number 2 for me is when Toby is spoken to by his rabbi about the death penalty. Toby speaks to PB about it, and PB mocks him to Leo by saying 'Toby went to schul' (apologies, don't know the spelling). Ironically though, PB had reached out to Fr Cavanagh from within his own religion to give him counsel.

534,"Question: Presidential Debate Formats Anyone who has watched both ‘The West Wing’ and ‘The Newsroom’ is likely familiar with both series take on the flawed US presidential debates. 

I always find this as an interesting take and really my answer is “Yes, sure I’d love to see more Sorkin-esque Presidential Debates”, but I just realized that the episodes this is really highlighted in occur post Sorkin years? Yes, this does come up during Bartlet’s re-election campaign but not as detailed prominently yet ‘The Newsroom’ has the exact same almost verbatim view on this in season one. 

This leaves me with two questions. 

Does anyone else feel that Aaron Sorkin’s view on “Debating” really is a great one that should be enacted? Would this make a difference and is it actually possible? 

And is this truly Sorkin’s view, since he claims to have never watched the post Sorkin years on TWW and plays out this exact debate fantasy on ‘The Newsroom’ ? 

I guess it’s possible the writing covered enough in the Bartlet re-elect, but it just doesn’t seem like it during this binge which is why I’m curious what other’s think. I always attributed this view to Aaron Sorkin. ",1

553,"Following along with all the Reboot Idea’s.... Doesn’t Congresswoman Wyatt make a lot of sense? [Andrea Wyatt(-Ziegler?) for president](https://imgur.com/a/b37VSw6)

[I was Inspired by this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/asy9jq/if_were_giving_reboot_ideas_heres_mine/?st=JSG9YL1X&amp;sh=f8afdc07) and then thought to myself seriously wouldn’t Congresswoman Wyatt make an excellent POTUS storyline in a reboot: 

1. A Female President ✔️ 

•Follows almost all current TV network trends.

•Definitely could serve to add even more to Sorkin’s specific brand of political idealism. 

2. She automatically injects countless opportunities for conflict. Her campaigning alone would takes us through numerous rollercoasters and of course even more while she was in office ✔️ 

•First off Toby’s connection to her alone serves this purpose. 

•Add in those pregnancy lawsuits. 

•Even her own season 7 (likely)come from behind congressional win, after having always won her district with 85% of the vote, all because Toby was charged. 

3. Andy Wyatt definitely provides probably the most legitimate reason’s to include or call back to serve, most if not all of the original ensemble ✔️ 

•They all served as trusted advisors to Bartlet together (think Debate Camp). 

•They all seemed to be roughly the same age/generation. This makes a lot more sense if you think about it-Bringing back what would be considered a much older administration with Charlie young as President would be harder if they all came right back into the WH and with Wyatt this plus they could all maybe even return with some as Sr staff. This is just more plausible with her. 

•Wyatt already worked with all of these political operatives why would she even change that? 

4. Wyatt would even be one of the easiest way’s for Sorkin to write the party politics the same way he did in the original ✔️ 

•Her political views mostly lined up with Bartlet’s Administration. 

•Her history would have obviously much more likely stayed the same course politically. 

5.She even sorta opens the door a little wider for old recurring only characters. 

•For example Amy could return with some pretty awesome storylines 

• This maybe gives Donna a much better shot at a more deserving role in an administration. 

•Especially since both Donna and Amy served in Santos administration and just as Amy was Abbeys COS Donna was Helen’s. 

•**But lets get to what’s really the most important here....I personally feel Andy was obviously always pretty tight with Ed and Larry and for me there’s simply just no possibility for a reboot without Ed and Larry!** 

6.She is probably the only possibility that really serves to legitimize Toby’s return well! 

*I’m just saying Congress Woman Wyatt really makes so much sense here and imo the most important reason for that is because so far she would serve as clearly the easiest way for Aaron Sorkin to overcome the major Toby problem which would absolutely be a gigantic obstacle for him.*

*Richard Schiffs Toby is one of Sorkin’s personal all time favorite characters he has ever written.  He says this a lot. Wyatt for president really does almost instantly overcome that objection and at the very least provides Sorkin opportunities that since S7 are very necessary for him to continue to write Toby Ziegler.*

*If anyone was actually going to get Toby back in the WH Wyatt for president is seemingly the only feasible way I can see that *somewhat believably* happening. Not to mention the much needed “friction” and “conflict” that would create for Sorkin to use in his typically dialogue heavy screenplays.*

*I can also see Wyatt not only bringing Toby back via the WH residence (which is of course the simplest way to do it, either Andy and Toby married or through the Twins personally either way works for me I love Toby too!) but imo it could even make the argument an easier one if it happens to be made by Wyatt, if anyone can make the argument to the public and the audience that Toby serve’s as a trusted advisor to any president again it’s gotta be Andy. Right?*

7.On top of all of that even the flashback-Cameo method could possibly be used a little easier with Andy Wyatt as President, but I really don’t think that’s necessary if they made this choice.  

imo the more I think about this it almost serves (maybe a little to perfectly) all of Sorkins needs to revisit the series. 

I can’t lie though I personally actually really want to see Sam Sea*Born for president* or Charlie Young as president. I just think Andy is the much more feasible option here. ",1

561,"A Conversation About Sorkin So I wanted to get some other folks opinion regarding my opinion of Aaron Sorkin.  First off, I'm a huge fan of almost everything he has done.  My IPad is littered with his movies, his TV shows, etc.  I probably have watched more of his stuff than any other screenwriter out there.  There is something that does bother me with his writing though.

I've been watching a lot of his movies lately.  Molly's Game, The Social Network, Moneyball and Jobs specifically.  All of these are movies I really like but there is one issue I have with them and it is the artistic license he seems to take with real people, ones that are also still alive.  My examples are below (and maybe I'm wrong about a few so please correct me where I am wrong):

- Moneyball:  That movie made Art Howe look really bad and he was not that against the Moneyball approach according to him.  Art has had to defend himself in print about this which I think is incredibly unfair.  Make Reese from The Newsroom look bad, fine.  Make a real person look bad when they weren't, I have an issue with that.Also, it's not as if the A's didn't already still have all-star pitching.  

- Molly's Game:  I'm totally fine with the Idris Elba being the ""eyes of the audience"" and not being real.  However, from what I understand is that Molly's main accident didn't occur the way it was depicted in the film.  The main motivation of her going to LA is based upon a false presence, which is fine in a made up story but it's hard to keep with that in a ""based on a true story"".    Also, the conversation with the father (I love Coestner in this film) never happened.  

- Jobs:  Again, my understanding is that all of the fights/arguments before the presentations never happened and the feelings of Steve W and others were misrepresented.  

Again, I'm a huge fan of Sorkin but it's these items just seem like plot devices and are not true to the story.

Anyway else agree or am I nuts?",1

RUSSELL Well, maybe that's not so bad. It wasn't my plan, but it might be a happy accident. Just the thing we need to put a little distance between us and them. I wouldn't worry about.

If the story that the Vice President leaked information that put Ellie in the cross hairs had come out, the Russell campaign would have been dead in the water.  Russell would have been frozen out by President Bartlet.

575,"West Wing Spinoff Ideas I was bored and I thought of a bunch of West Wing spinoff ideas.  Would you watch any of them?

&amp;#x200B;

**Keyworth**

Follows the psychiatric practice of Dr. Stanley Keyworth.  Each episode would be a session with a client.  If you've ever seen ""In Treatment"" with Gabriel Byrne, something like that.

**Tribbey &amp; Babbish**

Lionel Tribbey and Oliver Babbish, two former WH counsels, have started a law firm together in their post-political days.  They are the managing partners, and they have brought in Charlie Young(now a lawyer), and a stable of WW recurring characters - Ainsley Hayes, Cliff Calley, Joe Quincy, and Laurie(Sam's friend who was in law school) - for the firm.  Yeah, it's an unrealistic premise, but I have no doubt it would be good with all those characters as regulars.  Basically a lawyer show, but with potential to be more.

**Political Science 101**

Over a decade after he left the WH in scandal, this would follow Toby Ziegler as a professor of Political Science at Columbia.  Andy(still his ex-wife) and his now-college-age children Molly and Tuck would make regular appearances.  I guess his father Jules could also make an appearance or two, but Jerry Adler is 90 now, so I don't know.

We would see Toby lecturing his classes(plenty of opportunity for those great Toby monologues), dealing with students one-on-one, as a father, etc.  This would be a sort of quiet character piece about Toby.  Maybe a guest appearance now and then from former WWers, but for the most part, it would be just Toby.

**Red Lights**

Follows Josh and Donna as, post-Santos administration, they start a political consultancy firm, as full partners, and as husband and wife.

**Dr. Bartlet**

A hospital show with Dr. Eleanor ""Ellie"" Bartlet as the main character.

&amp;#x200B;

(A pair of prequels here, which would obviously need recasting for key roles)

**The Young Jed Bartlet**

This would follow Bartlet's years at Notre Dame.  Think of the flashbacks in ""Two Cathedrals"", except he's in college now.  That aesthetic.  We'd see him meet and begin a courtship with young Abbey, we'd see him studying economics and ditching his plans to be a priest, we'd find a way for young Mrs. Landingham to be there, maybe some appearances from Jed's dad.  Just the formative years of the future president.

**Hampshire**

This would follow Bartlet's years as governor of New Hampshire.  Aside from following all the political goings-on in New Hampshire(maybe there could be some run-ins with President Lassiter), we'd also see him develop his friendship with Leo(maybe we'd also see Leo as Secretary of Labor), we'd see him get diagnosed with MS, we'd see his daughters when they were younger, etc.  The final scene of the final episode would be the flashback from ""Bartlet For America"", where Leo comes to Bartlet's house and asks him to run for President.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Supremes**

This one's hardly original, but a show focusing on the SCOTUS with Evelyn Baker Lang, Christopher Mulready, and seven other fictional justices.

**Mandyville(Half joking here, but...)**

In which we find Mandy Hampton waking up from a coma she's been in for twenty years after having been shot in ""What Kind Of Day Has It Been?"".  At first we watch her re-orient herself to the world after having missed two decades, and then, after a while, pissed off, go looking for Josh and CJ to find out why nobody seemed to care or even notice that she was gone.",1

Donna tells Mrs Morello that it’s because of her that she is standing in the Oval Office. 

So I ask you all, who’s your Mrs Morello? Who got you to where you are and, if given the opportunity, would look to call and thank when they retire. 

Mine, too, was my high school English teacher. Because of him, my love for reading was rekindled; I am a better writer because of it; I pursued English lit in college and while I may work in insurance I still use that critical thinking and analysis. More importantly though he taught us to look at things from different angles, literally and figuratively, as he let four dorky kids film short movies for our final or reviewed The Crucible through a modern lens of discrimination. So, Mr Hashemian, if you’re reading this (and I like to believe you’re a fan of Sorkin), Thank You. I might not be standing in the Oval Office but you certainly helped me be successful in life.

583,"Would the “Mandy” character have worked if she was portrayed by Janel Moloney? I started a rewatch of the series and I’m showing it to my mom for her first time. No matter how many times I’ve seen these episodes, I’m still shocked to see Mandy in the Pilot. Then today I had this random shower thought: Janel Moloney’s natural chemistry with Bradley Whitford overpowered what ever was supposed to happen between Josh and Mandy, and essentially replaced Moira Kelly.

Not trying to shit on Moira Kelly, she’s a fine actress, but some people cannot speak Sorkin’s words the they’re meant to be said (pretentious, I know, but Exhibit A: The Newsroom). Mandy was supposed to be Josh’s “end-game” love interest but Janel and Brad just *worked* together, creating the inevitability of Josh and Donna’s romantic relationship. Then I got to thinking, if Mandy was played by Janel, would she have lasted and been more likable?

Janel naturally fit into Sorkin’s world and was able to land herself a permanent spot on the show, but Moira went through just the opposite. Unfortunately, Moira made Mandy an unbearable character. Janel is obviously capable of playing someone with a strong personality like Mandy’s (campaign/Santos Donna) and I imagined that if she played Mandy, Mandy could have been a character we love to hate. Janel and Brad’s ability to go back and forth, something he and Moira lacked, also would have brought a likability to Mandy. 

The show would be completely different if this happened. Even if Moira Kelly stayed on the show, what would Mandy even have done? She was always the “outsider” character and never really fit in with the rest of the staff.

Anyway, sorry if this is confusing and ramble-y but I’m curious to see what other people think of this. 

Edit: I’d imagine this scenario also including the Donna character, played by somebody else, and being more of the secondary/minor recurring character she was intended to be (like Ginger, Carol, etc.).",1

585,"•Angela Blake •Kate Harper •Ryan Pierce •Rina •Joe Quincy ....... What was with the massive amount of new and almost all useless characters who were introduced with their own “mini-arc” in S5 alone? 

 •Angela Blake •Ryan Pierce •Rina •Roy Ashland •Greg Brock •Jeff Haffley  •General Alexander •Kate Harper just to name a few.  

I mean sure some were definitely necessary, specifically I can see •Ashland, •Haffley •General Alexander (*I guess? but I will always prefer Fitzwallace*) and maybe •Brock (*since he was pretty much the Danny Concannon replacement, although I don’t remember why Timothy Busfield couldn’t or didn’t appear in S5*) but the sheer total of MandyVille retirees that appear in S5 alone seems ridiculous and unnecessary to me. 

At a minimum I’d say •Angela Blake •Rina •Joe Quincy (*who by all accounts seems to be the actual intended S5 Token Mandy replacement introduced in late S4, but Im sure I could be wrong about this*) and •Ryan Pierce all seem to fit this bill.  

This season definitely introduced most of my all time least favorite characters. That Top spots currently a tie for me between •Angela Blake (*Since I will always stick by Josh Lyman and who I possibly irrationally resent because of the way she really made Leo come of as adversarial during this arc*) and •Kate Harper (*She just wasn’t needed! Nancy McNally still appeared in these seasons why introduce her at all? Plus as irrational as it may seem I do blame her directly and almost solely for causing Leo’s heart attack*). Although Mandy will still always maintain a top placement on that list. 

Did this swarm of needless and endless introduction of new characters in S5 bring anyone else’s least favorite along with it?

___________________________________________________


I completely understand and also agree with those who will say that they think the California 47th campaign really hurts him or even that it completely disqualifies him here, but I’d counter that argument with the fact that by this point in the series timeline Sam Seaborn would’ve at the very least spent the last 8 years in the Santos administration as Josh Lyman’s Deputy COS in the WH.  Meaning he would have been a WH insider for over 12 years with plenty of campaign experience under his belt.  He also very likely could’ve taken another run at public office and won.  Just as Will Bailey did when he left the Bartlet WH and was elected to Congress in the Oregon 4th. 

I wonder more and more about this lately not only because of this dialogue from Hartsfield Landing, but also because the entire series was initially designed solely around Sam’s character as the main protagonist.  This is the most visible in the pilot for the series run, but he remained the protagonist for most if not all of the first season. 

I haven’t seen this concept or storyline mentioned at all in the many articles confirming Aaron Sorkin is “In talks of a West Wing reboot” 

I enjoy all of The West Wing characters and I agree there are numerous ways this new plot can develop, but am I really the only one wondering this? 

I’ve also wondered this same thing about Charlie Young’s character.  Although there was not any right on the nose dialogue to support this specific theory, I do feel there was definitely enough subtle foreshadowing throughout the series run to support this Character development.  Although I would agree that If Charlie married Zoey it could make this storyline somewhat less believable and at a minimum more difficult to explore and write. ",1
590,"Evidence of Things Not Seen Yet another mistake with regard to military decorations. At around 16:13 there's a shot of Will Bailey in his Air Force uniform, and his ribbons are pinned on upside down. My love for this series knows no bounds, but as a veteran of the United States Air Force, these mistakes really annoy me.

There are several of these issues throughout the show, all of them having to do with military medals and ribbons either being pinned on the wrong way or being misrepresented by the writers. I really wish the producers would have paid closer attention to these important (however minuscule) details. It just makes me feel like they said, ""Okay, let's just slap some ribbons on the costume. It doesn't really matter if they're on correctly. We don't have time to worry about that."" This isn't a parody. The actors are wearing exact replicas of uniforms worn by members of our armed forces, and they should be represented correctly.

608,"I ran like Leo (long rant) One of my closest friends was in a freak accident yesterday. He was driving along with his father and out of nowhere a metal rod fell loose from a truck, pierced the windshield and lodged itself in his skull, going completely through it.
Somehow he survived, but he's in a deep coma, and after a delicate three hour extraction from the car wreck they have been operating on him for nine hours straight.
I was a groomsman at his wedding, and his wife, also one of my closest friends, was my godmother (I was only baptized at 27, having grown up in a non-religious left-wing family).
As soon as I heard about the accident I ran out of the government office I work in (I'm a political operative, and everyone was very caring and understanding, thankfully), and got in an uber bound for the hospital.
They're only thirty-one years old like myself, and just got a beautiful baby boy eight months ago to join their lovely one-and-a-half year old blond girl. The kids are at home with their grandmother, and once I got to the hospital and did my clumsy best at comforting her, I tried to get through to some of my medical connections to see if we could get some unofficial information on his condition (doctors will often only inform relatives once they've got something conclusive).
He's in a deep coma and we don't know how long it'll take for him to come back, but thankfully it seems any brain damage was minor, in what can only be described as a miracle within a tragedy.
After a while hospital staff politely asked us non-relatives to leave, so we went outside and kept our vigil throughout the night.
Now it's three a.m. and we're freezing our asses off but everyone refuses to leave until we hear how the operation went. It's mighty cold here in Europe in peak winter, but thank God I brought my trusty winter coat, West-Wing style.
Finally some family members come down and tell us the operation went well, but it'll take some time for us to know the full results. Everyone is relieved, for as small as they might seem at this point, every good news count. Then they tell us he's in ICU, and that our friend's wife (my best friend and godmother) insisted on seeing him before going home to soothe her children, even in this mangled state.
We panic, for we know as strong and brave as she is, it'll be a sight that might break her. So we scramble to the various exits hoping to catch her as she leaves, and make sure she gets home safe.
I'm walking towards my assigned exit as one of our friends calls me saying she was spotted coming my way, and I start to pick-up speed, going from a fast walk to a full-on sprint, not in an instant (don't ask me why, I guess my brain wasn't fully there yet after all the tribulations of that day) but rather slowly, so I literally do the ""Leo run"" from the season 4 finale, stopping at last in front of the hospital door panting, just in time to hug my best friend and godmother on the hardest night of her life.

612,"Bartlet's Daughters I saw in comments of another post that there might not be much love for Ellie for some people, but for me, she was my favourite Bartlet sister. Even though she doesn't have a ton of appearances (just for reference, Liz has 6, Ellie has 9, and Zoey has 25) she does have an arc and I think I find her the most believable out of the three characters. 

It's kinda hard to judge Liz as a character; I'd say 4 of her 6 appearances (7A, Dogs of War, Abu el Banat, and Requiem) were little more than cameos. The only storyline she had was in season 6 when her ass of a husband was running for Congress and when he was having an affair (both minor plots). I mean she clearly wanted to stay out of the spotlight and was both mature and smart enough to do so. Sure she had a questionable choice for a husband but she made her father's life easier by not adding to his troubles. 

As for Zoey, I did like her, don't get me wrong, but I found the whole hanging out with questionable characters (Jean-Paul) and not taking her secret service protection seriously in season 4 (even though her father had been shot 4 years prior), was kinda cliche. We don't see much character  development, even though she appears in 25 episodes (sure she was far from a  main character so I wouldn't have expected a ton of development but we see more development in Ellie in much fewer appearances).

Maybe it's the middle child in me, but I always found myself identifying more with Ellie. She did not want anything to do with her father's career choice and does a good job at staying out of it, except when she wants to stand up for someone she supports (when she spoke out in support of the Surgeon General). In Ellie we see her very distant to her father, yet in the last season we see her willing to have a White House wedding when she very easily could have eloped or done something quieter.",1

Specifically, I am asking you to rank your **FIVE favorite episodes from  Season 1 ranked from 1-5**.  I can then provide a list of the votes (5 points for 1st, 4 for 2nd, etc) and we can see what the consensus is.

Feel free to add a paragraph or sentence (or nothing) about why you love the episode.  I have definitely seen other people get turned on to different episodes because someone has a great perspective and shares it.

*EDIT 1:*  I am loving the responses so far so my plan will be to keep the votes going through the weekend and then starting Season 2's list on Monday or Tuesday and post the final results for S1.  Lots of of the expected favorites but you can already see some different choices showing up.  Can anything beat the front-runners of 'Take this Sabbath Day' or 'Celestial Navagation' or 'In Excelsis Deo'?  We will see…

*EDIT 2:*  So I haven't gotten anything new lately so I will post the totals.  Only four episodes did not receive a single vote - *Post Hoc, Ergo Proctor Hoc*, *20 Hours in LA*, *The White House Pro-Am*, *Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics*.

It was a two horse race for first place, ***In Excelsis Deo*** tied with ***Celestial Navigation*** with 30 points.  *In Excelsis* had more total votes, *Celestial* more first place votes.  Third Place was ***Take This Sabbath Day***. After that was a decent gap and then a bunching of episodes with ***Mr Willis Of Ohio*** and ***Let Bartlet Be Bartlet*** leading that group.

An example...when they gather at the inaugural ball for the president to make Will Bailey officially part of the staff, she is the only one there (besides Charlie who is there actually helping the president) that is not senior staff. Where's Ginger? She's the communication assistant.

Another one off the top of my head...when senior staff meets for breakfast... Margaret is there with Leo, which makes perfect sense to me as he's COS. But the only other assistant present is Donna. Where's Carol? Where's Ginger?

636,"Process Stories/Inauguration: Part 1 - Jack Reese's Military Decorations [SPOILER] for anyone not past S04E07

In keeping with the theme from my post on Adm. Fitzwallace's medals, there are yet more errors in conjunction with the use of military decorations that should be pointed out, but these are far more obvious. Jumping ahead to ""Inauguration: Part 1"", during the scene when Donna lets Josh know that the tickets for the balls came, she shows off her knowledge (or lack thereof) about Jack's dress blues and lists his decorations. The line is, ""Warfare pin, submarine officer pin, two commendation medals, meritorious unit, purple heart, bronze cross and a saber.""

We'll begin with the fact that amongst the long list of U.S. military decorations, there is no such thing as a ""bronze cross"". There is the bronze star and the purple heart, neither of which Jack possesses. Going back to ""Process Stories"", we can clearly see Jack's ribbon rack and his insignias. They are as follows - Navy achievement (not commendation) medal (x1) with a ""V"" for valor, meritorious unit commendation (x1), Navy ""E"" ribbon (x1), Navy &amp; Marine Corps overseas service ribbon (x1), submarine officer warfare insignia and his Joint Chiefs of Staff identification badge, which is worn by staff and support personnel assigned to the Office of the Chairman and the Joint Staff. The only one she was correct about was his meritorious unit commendation, because when she said ""warfare pin, submarine officer pin"", the line was clearly written to indicate two separate pins. There is only one pin for submarine officer and enlisted personnel, and that is the submarine warfare insignia, or ""fish"", that is awarded after extensive training on all the boat's systems. Gold denotes officer, silver denotes enlisted. The others Donna speaks of (besides the non-existent bronze cross) are clearly not on his rack.

By the way, for the sake of anyone who might think I'm attempting to trash the show, please be aware that I'm in the camp of those who think this is the greatest TV show ever produced. Speaking ill of our beloved TWW is not my intent. But I'm also a veteran of the U.S. Air Force and a stickler for continuity, and have always been disappointed with the surprising lack of attention the producers sometimes paid to matters of military uniform continuity. Perhaps they thought the show would never be watched again after the first airing and that no one would catch these little details. But when they wrote Donna's line, which I quoted at the top of the post, all they needed to do was go back and quickly look at the two or three seconds of the scene in Jack's office and take note of the decorations they adorned his uniform with. Taking the time to do a little due diligence wouldn't have cost them anything. And before anyone brings it up, I already checked his oval office scene in Arctic Radar, and no change was made to his decorations between the two episodes. ",1

642,"Ranking Characters: The Regulars So, over a year ago I started this project of ranking characters.  In late 2017 I posted the one-offs, sometime in Spring 2018 I posted the 2-4 recurring episode thread, then late last summer I posted the 5-10 episode recurring and 11+ episode recurring threads in close proximity to each other.  All of those lists garnered positive reception(though the most recent 11+ episode recurring one garnered some rather heated disagreement over my placement of Ainsley Hayes(she was #10 overall, not that low!) and even Bob Russell).

If don't remember or weren't around when those threads were posted, here are the links to the previous posts, to refresh your memory - maybe have a look:

Anyway, I got sidetracked with other things so it's been a while, but today I'm posting the final installment of the project.  This has taken me a while to write.  I mean, it's a hell of a lot of writing, so I hope someone actually takes the time to read it all.  Most probably won't.  Oh well.

I'm actually posting two lists here.  The first will be a brief list ranking and acknowledging some of what we'll call the non-credited regulars - characters who are seen on a regular basis but are never seen in the credits - these are mostly assistants, but there are a couple of others as well.

The second list will be the main one, the fifteen characters who have appeared in the opening credits, with much more writing than the first list.

Without further ado...

# Non-Credited Regulars

**8. Cathy / Portrayed by Suzy Nakamura**

**Appeared in 9 episodes, Season 1**

Cathy was an additional assistant that Sam had for nine episodes in the first season, after which she went to Mandyville.  She is often forgotten in conversations like this.  Not much say to really.

**7. Nancy / Portrayed by Renee Estevez**

**Appeared in 44 episodes, seasons 1-7**

Played by Martin Sheen's daughter, Nancy was a direct assistant to the President, seen every now and then coming in and out of whatever room he's in to tell him that so-and-so is here or such-and-such wants to speak to him, among other things.

**6. White House Press Corp reporters Katie Witt, Mark O'Donnell, Steve, and Chris / Portrayed by Kris Murphy, Timothy Davis-Reed, Charles Noland, and Mindy Seeger**

**Katie Witt appeared in 53 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

**Mark O'Donnell appeared in 43 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

**Steve appeared in 52 episodes, Seasons 2-7**

**Chris appeared in 34 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

Ok, so these are the four - and I think they're the only ones - press corp reporters that appear regularly with dialogue.  I felt it was important to acknowledge them because having some familiar faces in the press room throughout adds continuity and makes the show feel more realistic in those scenes.  I've included the four of them together instead of individually because none of them has enough screen time to have gotten to know any of them, but together they should be acknowledged.  If you don't know who they are by name, here are some photos to jog your memory(Steve and Chris don't have last names because they don't have last names on iMDB):

**5. Bonnie / Portrayed by Devika Parikh**

**Appeared in 41 episodes, Seasons 1-5**

One of two long-term assistants in the communications office who served Toby and Sam(and later Will).  Always being given many order, always dependable.  Disappeared for some reason in the post-Sorkin years.

**4. Ed &amp; Larry / Portrayed by Peter James Smith and William Duffy**

**Appeared in 47/48 episodes, respectively, Seasons 1-7**

I feel like Ed &amp; Larry existed because while Toby had people who reported directly to him(Sam, C.J., Will), Josh never did, outside of Donna.  They were there to make it look like there were other people working under Josh.

So they're often seen in meetings about legislative-type things, they seem competent enough, and they're funny too from time to time.

**3. Ginger / Portrayed by Kim Webster**

**Appeared in 58 Episodes, Seasons 1-7**

The other long-term assistant in the communications office.  I've always felt that Kim Webster really gave Ginger a good deal of personality in her relatively limited screen time.  She always seemed feisty, unintimidated, not afraid to give Toby some lip from time to time.  I always liked her.

**2. Carol Fitzpatrick / Portrayed by Melissa Fitzgerald**

**Appeared in 102 Episodes, Seasons 1-7**

C.J.'s right-hand in the press office(still seen but less so after C.J. becomes chief of staff), she was always such a positive person, happy to be there, and uber-competent at her job as well.  Always liked that her and C.J. seemed to have a genuine friendship.  Seems like everybody likes Carol.

**1. Margaret Hooper / Portrayed by NiCole Robinson**

**Appeared in 106 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

The obvious #1 here.  The executive assistant to the chief of staff under both Leo and C.J., Margaret was a wonderfully kooky, offbeat character(NiCole Robinson deserves all the credit in the world for bringing her to life).  Her eccentric demeanor can sometimes mask the fact that she is as good as anybody could be at her job, that Leo and C.J. would be lost without her, and that she cares deeply about her bosses and her job.  I think C.J. got right to the point with this bit of dialogue:

&gt;You're an odd woman.  I've never understood you.  But you're extremely capable.  You run this office like a watch.  You're tall, which is reassuring.  Leo may need you, and if he does, that's okay.  But if he's willing to part with you, I hope you'll stay.

Margaret is as memorable is any other character.

And now the final list...

# The Regulars

And we reach the final list of the project.

As an aside, it's never easy to put characters in an order like this, much less the *main* characters.  Some decisions were easier than others.  The top seven in particular was murderously difficult to put in order, aside from the top two which were a given to me at the outset.  All of these characters are so great, it hurts to put anyone lower than they might have been.  But I figure there's no order I can put them in that won't piss somebody off, so I may as well just put them in the order I feel is right, which after much deliberation and mind-changing, is exactly what I have done.  Without further ado...

**15. Mandy Hampton / Portrayed by Moira Kelly**

**Appeared In: 20 Episodes(+2 credit-only), Season 1**

**Title: White House Media Consultant, Season 1**

As if it was going to be anybody else at #15.  Moira Kelly is a great actress, I don't think anyone has ever blamed her, but the character just was not likable.  She didn't fit in.  The show was an idealistic, aspirational view of government, and in the Sorkin years(it was different post-Sorkin), the conflict was always between Bartlet's staff and whoever was opposing them.  It was them against the world.  That dynamic was essential to what made the show what it was.  Having someone inside the team constantly arguing with and antagonizing other members of the team didn't work.

Additionally, she just came across as a shallow person.  She seemed to always care more about how something looked or how something would play than about what the administration was actually doing.  Yes, her job was as a media consultant, but C.J.'s job dealt with the media as well and she always cared 100% as much about the real stuff as she did about how it played, hell, she probably cared MORE about the real stuff.

The character just didn't work well.  Although I've never been a fan of characters just disappearing without explanation.

**14. Kate Harper / Portrayed by Mary McCormack**

**Appeared In: 30 Episodes(+18 credit-only), Seasons 5-7**

**Title: Deputy National Security Advisor, Seasons 5-7**

IIRC, Kate was not a very popular character at the time, when the Post-Sorkin seasons were first airing, but has maybe grown a little in popularity over the years.

There are several issues with Kate, IMO.

One is that, like Mandy, she is more of a pragmatist in a world populated with idealists.  Bartlet's staff were all, to varying degrees, passionate and partisan, and would breathe fire to defend their convictions.  In contrast, Kate was not a politician or a political operative, having come from a military/defense background, and would often come off as colder and more dispassionate.  I just felt like it didn't jive a lot of the time.

Another is that she essentially ended up replacing the far superior character of Nancy McNally.  Nancy appears in 20 episodes total, and ""Talking Points"", in which she introduces Kate to Bartlet(and us) near the end of season 5, is the 17th.  She only appeared in three more episodes in the following two seasons.  Any time Nancy would've ordinarily been there, Kate is there instead.  If that was the intent, I can't support it.

To me, after many re-watches, it just seems to me that Wells and his team knew ahead of time that Josh was going to leave the WH in season 6, that Leo was going to be in a reduced role, that Will was going to be on the campaign trail a lot, and that with basically only Bartlet, C.J., and Toby left, they simply needed another character to be in the WH as a regular.  With a few exceptions(the middle east peace summit at the beginning of season 6), her plots were usually filler and not all that important.

**13. Annabeth Schott / Portrayed by Kristin Chenoweth**

**Appeared In: 23 Epsiodes(+11 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: Deputy Press Secretary, Season 6**

**Aide to Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate Leo McGarry, Season 7**

Annabeth would've been higher on this list if she'd appeared in more episodes.  Kristen Chenoweth has a magnetic personality, and she succeeds in the delicate balancing act of making the character so relentlessly upbeat and bright and positive without being annoying.  It's impossible not to like her.

Yet, despite the happy nature of the character, her most memorable and effective scene is easily in the hospital in ""Election Day, Part 2"", when, her face drenched in tears, she informs Josh(and us) that Leo McGarry has passed on.  Chenoweth killed it in that scene.

I want to rank her higher, but as likable as she is, her role just wasn't substantial enough to put any higher.

**12. Will Bailey / Portrayed by Joshua Malina**

**Appeared In: 71 Episodes(+9 credit-only), Seasons 4-7**

**Title: White House Deputy Director Of Communications, Season 4**

**Chief Of Staff to the Vice-President Of The United States, Season 5**

**Campaign Manager, Russell Campaign, Season 6**

**White House Director Of Communications, Season 7**

Will is perhaps the most frustrating character on this list, and I struggled with where to place him.  The Will of season 4 is a genuinely likable guy, a little aloof, a little in over his head, but a good guy, super intelligent, hard worker, awed by where he finds himself, working in the White House.

But his character was essentially sacrificed in season 5 - the awed, aloof guy who believed in certain principles enough to get a dead guy elected, who excelled at speechwriting, turned into an ambition-driven operative in order to set him up as Russell's campaign manager and Josh's foil in the season 6 primaries.   And then in season 7, he's almost an afterthought, his most memorable moments being his ascension to the title of White House Director Of Communications after Toby's firing, and his much-maligned romance with Kate(it was a decent idea on paper, but they had no chemistry).

Malina is a good actor - anything that went wrong with the character was not his fault at all - and when I see Will in his good moments, it frustrates me because of what he could've been, but his bad moments, when he's reduced to acting so punk-ish to Josh and so forth because the plot calls for it, are enough to drag him down this low.

**11. Matthew ""Matt"" Santos / Portrayed by Jimmy Smits**

**Appeared In: 35 Episodes(+2 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: United States Congressman From Texas, Season 6**

**Democratic Nominee for President Of The United States/President-Elect Of The United States, Season 7**

I think both of the season 6-7 candidate characters were well-written and well-performed, and had either of them existed for longer than 1.5 seasons, they'd probably rank higher on the list, but they were only around for a small slice of the show, so I can't see ranking either any higher than this - though they were always going to be at the top of 10-15 range, as they are pretty easily the best-written and best-performed and most important of those characters.

I put Santos one rung lower than Vinick, and the reason will be clear in the Vinick write-up.  For right now, I'll just say what I like about Santos.

The character was conceived shortly after Obama's 2004 convention speech.  He was based on Obama and, some might say, in turn had some influence on the 2008 election in which Obama was elected in real life.  The character was supposed to have many of the same characteristics as the real Obama - young, charismatic, unabashedly liberal, etc.

Santos displayed two traits throughout the campaign - integrity and insecurity.  Integrity in that he didn't want to do an attack ad in ""Freedonia"", in that he didn't initially want to make a photo-op out of his service as a military reserve, integrity in turning Russell's VP offer down, integrity in not bowing out at the convention because ""it's not my place to decide who the nominee should be.  That decision is yours and yours alone"".  Also, if you believe the story he told Vinick(and I see no reason not to), he displayed integrity in stepping up to support his irresponsible brother's child because it was the right thing to do.

He was insecure about his ability to play the game of presidential politics, especially at the beginning - there were a number of occasions in which Josh would have to teach Santos how to play the game, and Santos would express frustration at having to do what in his view were such trivial things instead of talking about real issues that mattered.

I appreciated his willingness and determination to hold onto his integrity in the face of losing, of not being comfortable with the game of presidential politics until he could figure out how to play it on his own terms.

In terms of policy, he was an ideal liberal, and nowhere was that more front-and-center than in the debate episode, in which he advocated for medicare-for-all, green energy, public education, and more, and put a bow on it with his defense of the liberal label:

&gt;Yes, a liberal Republican, Senator. What happened to them? They got run out of your party. What did liberals do that was so offensive to the liberal party? I'll tell you what they did. Liberals got women the right to vote. Liberals got African-Americans the right to vote. Liberals created Social Security and lifted millions of elderly people out of poverty. Liberals ended segregation. Liberals passed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act. Liberals created Medicare. Liberals passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. What did Conservatives do? They opposed them on every one of those things,   every one. So when you try to hurl that label at my feet, 'Liberal,' as if it were something to be ashamed of, something dirty, something to run away from, it won't work, Senator, because I will pick up that label and I will wear it as a badge of honor.

Matt Santos was a great, charismatic character, a beacon of liberalism, and shares many qualities with Obama, whom I consider to be the one of the greatest presidents we've had.  So why is he above Vinick?  Read on.

**10. Arnold Vinick / Portrayed by Alan Alda**

**Appeared In: 18 Episodes(+10 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: United States Senator From California, Season 6**

**Republican Nominee for President Of The United States/Secretary Of State-Designate, Season 7**

So why Vinick above Santos?  Because Vinick is a Republican whose politics I vehemently disagree with and who I would never vote for against any decently capable Democrat, but who I still like a great deal, and I know many share that opinion.  To create such a character on a show dominated by very vocal liberals and Democrats, whose audience is mostly very liberal, is, from both a writing and acting standpoint, simply a heavier lift than to create a character like Santos.  It's that simple.

From a writing standpoint, to create a moderate Republican, a liberal Republican, a pro-choice Republican from California, was a great contrast to the rightward lurch the party was experiencing and continues to experience in real life.  To use the platform to show what a Republican used to be and what it still could be was ingenious.

From an acting standpoint, they hit a home run with Alda.  I mean, Jimmy Smits is a very good actor.  He is.  But Alda is a legendary actor, a national treasure.  He played the character note-perfectly, made him a three-dimensional, complicated, genuine, well-intentioned, downright warm, person.  I really don't think the character would've worked nearly as well as it did or been liked as much as he was in the hands of a lesser actor.  Alda is probably the #1 reason I'm ranking Vinick this high.

I'd also mention that, like Santos, Vinick was also a man of great integrity.  When Bruno found Santos's briefcase and gave it to Vinick, a lot of candidates would've ran with it, but what did Vinick do?  He set up a meeting with Santos, gave him a chance to explain himself, took him at his word, and didn't use it.  In ""The Al Smith Dinner"", he ultimately chose to denounce the ad attacking Santos's pro-choice position even though it would've scored him points with the right wing, because it would've been disingenuous on his part not to.  In ""In God We Trust"", he declined to go to church because it would've been phony:

&gt;Look, I respect Reverend Butler.  And I respect his church too much to use it for my own political purposes.  And That's exactly what I'd be doing if I went down there this Sunday.  Because the truth is, it would just be an act of political phoniness.  I may be wrong but I suspect our churches already have enough political phonies in them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Senator, do you or do you not--?  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't see how we can have a separation of church and state in this government if you have to pass a religious test to get in this government.  And I wanna warn everyone in the press and all the voters out there.  If you demand expressions of religious faith from politicians, you are just begging to be lied to.  They won 't all lie to you, but a lot of them will, and it'll be the easiest lie they ever had to tell to get your votes.  So every day until the end of this campaign, I'll answer any question anyone has on government.  But if you have a question on religion, please, go to church.  Thank you.

Finally, in ""Election Day, Part 2"", after receiving news of Leo's death, Vinick's advisors tell him he should challenge a Santos win on grounds of tainted electors in the wake of Leo's passing.  Vinick refuses to use Leo's death that way:

&gt;How about creating a conscience for ourselves? I've known Leo for 20 years.  Can we please not use him as a step stool?

Aside from all of that, I thought both the writers and Alda did a great job of showing the humanity within the politician, particularly towards the end - when he got sick from shaking so many hands, and then after the election, in ""The Last Hurrah"", when we get to see go overnight from almost being president to being, relatively speaking, no one.

He was just a great, thought-provoking character, despite being politically the opposite of me and most of the show's audience.

*Here is a demarcation point.  I consider all of the characters ahead to be the 'core' cast.  They are 'the family'.  The characters 15-10 are not 'in the family', not even Will.  These are the characters who were there from beginning to end(even if it took Charlie a couple episodes to appear and even if Sam was gone for a few years).*

**9. Charlie Young / Portrayed by Dule Hill**

**Appeared in 131 Episodes(+6 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: Personal Aide to the President, Seasons 1-6**

**Deputy Special Assistant/Aide to the White House Chief Of Staff, Seasons 6-7**

Charlie was an improbable character - a college-age kid whose father wasn't in his life, whose mother was killed, who at such a young age was thrust into being the primary guardian over his younger sister, who then later on became the target of an act of terror.  You might think that such a person might be hardened, cynical, jaded, but Charlie somehow remains emotionally open.  The combination of that emotional maturity, uncommon intelligence, and general kind demeanor is what defines the character.

Watching this wounded kid take advantage of the opportunity of a lifetime, watching him grow up before our eyes, watching his relationship with Bartlet blossom as they become surrogate father-and-son, watching his on-and-off relationship the first-daughter Zoey, is a joy.

I enjoy his snarkiness from time to time as well.  In ""Shibboleth"" he and Mrs. Landingham have the following exchange about the knife:

&gt;MRS. LANDINGHAM: He's very particular.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE That's one word for it.

In ""Gone Quiet"", he and Bartlet have this conversation:

&gt;BARTLET: That makes sense. Also, there's a chance I could get hit getting on or off.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: \[laughs a little\] Yeah.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Excuse me?  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: Sir?  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: You think I'm not tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One?  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: I think Dikembe Mutombo isn't tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One.

And in Arctic Radar, after Bartlet screams at the UN Secretary-General about parking tickets, Charlie responds with perfect timing:

&gt;BARTLET: \[screaming\] There are big signs! You can't park there! They should get towed! I hope they get towed to Queens and the Triboro is closed and there's a big craft show at Shea, a flea market or a tractor show!  
&gt;  
&gt;He hangs up.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: Well, that was probably his secretary.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Damn it.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: You can bet she'll be parking it in a garage, though.

Charlie's awesome.

**8. Donnatella 'Donna' Moss / Portrayed by Janel Moloney**

**Appeared In 142 Episodes(+8 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: Senior Assistant to the White House Deputy Chief Of Staff, Seasons 1-6**

**Aide/Spokeswoman, Russell Campaign, Season 6**

**Spokeswoman, Santos Campaign, Season 7**

Who doesn't love Donna?

There's her kind, sweet disposition.  Excepting the times Josh annoys her past her breaking point, she always has a warmth about her.  She always has a bright and sunny outlook and always cares for others.  This is evident in the way she always takes care of Josh on a personal level(she's often the only one who can calm him down when he's worked up), how she was all worried in ""The Fall's Gonna Kill You"" about a satellite falling to Earth and potentially hurting people, how she wanted a proclamation for her teacher Mrs. Morello in ""Stirred"", and so on.

She's also highly intelligent, competent, and resourceful.  She is portrayed as kind of flaky sometimes, but I think that's a mirage.  Like in that flashback in ""In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen"" where Donna claims to have had five majors and two minors?  I actually take that to mean she has a degree of intellectual curiosity such that she can't decide which subject to stick with.  This is a person that didn't have the clear path that pretty much every other character on this list other than Charlie did - she didn't go to or graduate from elite schools, she had no big career plan, none of that.  To go from where she was, coming off the street with no degree or experience, to boldly start working for someone who never hired you, to scratch and claw and work so hard and get up where did, doing what she did, you can't do that if you're not a highly intelligent individual.  And over the years she became uber-competent at her job and invaluable to her superiors.

Her girl-next-door looks don't hurt either.

I think Donna had one of the best post-Sorkin arcs, and therefore one of the best overall arcs, of any character, in terms of growth.  While she was uber-competent at her job, over the years she began to feel like she was outgrowing being someone's assistant, like she wanted to do more.  This became an underlying source of tension, as I'm sure Josh at least subconsciously was afraid of losing her, in more ways than one, and thus dragged his feet in terms of giving her opportunity for growth - despite doing it in little ways like sending her to Gaza as part of the model.

So she left him and went out and grew as a person and as a professional before they finally re-connected during the general election, and she got to end her story becoming the chief-of-staff to the incoming first lady.  It's just a satisfying character arc for a good person who deserved good things - she started as a 20-something looking for her place in the world and ended up having found it and then some.

**7. Sam Seaborne / Portrayed by Rob Lowe**

**Appeared In: 80 Episodes(+5 credit-only)**

**Title: White House Deputy Director Of Communications, Seasons 1-4**

**White House Deputy Chief Of Staff-designate, Season 7**

The OG main character.

Sam was a different breed than than Josh and Toby.  Whereas the latter two(and even Leo) went straight into politics, Sam is the only one that actually practiced law.  Perhaps this is why he often seems more level-headed, even-keeled, emotionally adjusted than Josh and Toby, and why his style of argument might seem more disciplined, whereas Josh and Toby use a more impassioned, fiery mode of debate.

Because of all of this, Sam is perhaps more likely to to see the bigger picture in certain cases where Josh and Toby would be more likely to be focused on the trenches in the political fight of the moment.  They live for the political fight, they fight like their lives depend on it.  Sam can certainly get worked up when he wants to, but in general, he's more likely to be pragmatic, to compromise and fight another day.  He doesn't *need* politics the way they do(hence his decision to practice law instead multiple times).

I think they also differ in that Josh and Toby, to quote Bartlet, want to be the guy the guy depends on.  Sam sometimes behaves more like he wants to eventually be the guy.  Maybe that's why Bartlet said he'd be president someday.

Sam is a great character, easily lovable, but because he is, as said before, more emotionally even, even-keeled, outwardly kind, etc, but because he is neither a brooding cauldron of angst and despair like Toby nor a pressure-cooker of feverish restlessness and intensity like Josh, he is actually just a little bit less interesting than them as a character.

**6. Dr. Abigail ""Abbey"" Bartlet / Portrayed by Stockard Channing**

**Appeared In: 57 Episodes(+12 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: First Lady Of The United States, Seasons 1-7**

This will probably be the most disagreed-with placement on this list.  I can feel your side-eyes and WTF expressions.

Abbey is, for some reason, a polarizing character.  I, for one, love her.  She is one half of the most believable couple I've ever seen on a TV show, and imo her character elevates Jed and makes him better, while at the same time standing as a formidable woman, a woman to be reckoned with, in her own right.

I've always thought Stockard Channing was magnificent in the role, some of the best work of her career, fully deserving of the Emmy she won for her work in the third season(""Gone Quiet"", ""Dead Irish Writers"").  She really sold the character as a real, breathing person with her own personality, her own considerable mind, her own dreams and regrets and motivations, her own career, who made a big sacrifice with said career for her husband(first by giving up her work, and then by voluntarily giving up her medical license).  She has her own politics, her own disappointments, her own resentments, but above all she loves her husband and her children fiercely.  She has just always felt like such a real, lived character.

I love the arguments between the two of them, how they challenge each other.  Whether it's the showdown in ""The White House Pro-Am"" about Bartlet ""handling"" her, the ""we had a deal"" spat and everything surrounding it in ""Bartlet's Third State of the Union""/""The War At Home"", or the extended argument in ""Manchester"" after he decides to run again, she can stand up to Jed and take him down a peg like no one else, can say things to him that no one else can say, because when it's just the two of them, he's not the president, he's just her husband.  I think it shows a healthy relationship as they don't keep things inside, the duke it out, and more often than not, they end up making up and moving forward.

That's not to discount the more tender moments they share - as you need both the arguments and the tender moments to paint a full and realistic portrait of this couple and this woman.  There are many examples.  Think of the end of ""And It's Surely To Their Credit"" - Bartlet has been clear to be intimate with his wife again after the shooting, but Abbey had punished for making fun of Nellie Bly, so at the episode's conclusion he makes his radio address all about historically important women to atone, and this playful exchange ensues:

&gt;TECHNICIAN: We're out.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Do it live, that's what I always say.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Very nice, babe.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: By the way, sweet knees, the Statue of Liberty.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Get upstairs.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Right there at the front door to the country!  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Get upstairs.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Like a lawn jockey.  
&gt;  
&gt;C.J.: \[comes in\] Mr. President?  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Ah, C.J., the President's going to take a little personal staff time right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: No, it's okay. \[stage whispers\] I'll be right behind you.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Special garment...  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Go.  
&gt;  
&gt;Abbey leaves.

Think of that conversation with Oliver Babbish in ""18th and Potomac"" in which he's urging her not to do the interview with Bartlet, and they argue for a bit, and she finally says to him, in a more vulnerable voice:

&gt;I'd like to be next to my husband when he does this

Or her conversation with Bartlet in the car at the end of Manchester, Part II, in which they make up after being distant all episode:

&gt;BARTLET: Did you know that hardly any of the guys who landed on the moon are married to the same people they were married to before they went there?  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (looks at him, puzzled) What?  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'm just saying it could be worse. I could've been an astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (slightly amused, but concealing it) You could not have been an astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'd have been a great astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: You're afraid of heights, speed, fire, and small places.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'd have overcome it to go to the moon.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (pauses to look at him)I know you would have.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: (pauses to look at her) I'm really happy you're introducing me. I'm really happy about that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Neither one of them says anything for a few moments.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: There's something important I have to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Say it.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I haven't really made up my mind yet... but at the moment... I'm leaning towards voting for you.  
&gt;  
&gt;They look at each other for several moments, hints of smiles on their faces.  Then he looks back out the window.

Or her conversation with Bartlet in ""Dead Irish Writers"", in which she tells me she's forfeiting her medical license:

&gt;Bartlet holds out his hand and takes Abbey aside. The band continues to play.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I called Nolan. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm sorry. The rules are different when it comes to my family. There isn't a man in America who doesn't understand that. I also think partiality isn't a vice in this case. He knows you, and that's a good thing. He's gonna consider not recusing himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I'm gonna voluntarily forfeit my license for the duration of our stay in the White House.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her decision comes as a surprise. Bartlet is speechless. The guests start to sing.  
&gt;  
&gt;GUESTS O, Canada, our home and native land True patriot love in all thy sons' command With glowing hearts, we see thee rise...  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet finally conjures up a response.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Okay. I'm gonna do a toast and everything in a minute, and I'll tell the ditch story, but I wanted to say that I love you very much.  
&gt;  
&gt;Abbey is taken aback, fighting back tears.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I love you too, Jethro.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Don't call me that.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I think I will.

In ""Game On"", just before Bartlet goes on stage for the debate, Abbey is affectionate towards him, and also cuts his tie off for luck:

&gt;ABBEY: We'll do mushy later. So, for now, I just got to say I love you so much that my head's going to fly off. But, more importantly, game on, boyfriend! Let's go!  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Okay.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: By the way, I feel bad. I don't think I've done enough to help you prepare for this debate.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Why are you telling me this now?  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet turns around to look back, when Abbey pulls out a pair of scissors and cuts off his tie.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Just 'cause.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet looks down at his tie, then up at Abbey who has a sly grin on her face.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Oh, my God. You're insane. Are you...? You're insane! Charlie!

Or ""Process Stories"", in which she and Bartlet are being all playful with one another on election night after he's won re-election.

I could go on, but you get the idea.  She's just a great combination of a woman with her own life, work, ambitions, etc, a good mother, and a loving wife who can tear her husband a new one when necessary and show great affection in equal measure.  She's a complex character, and those are usually the best.

I will add the caveat that I don't love the season 5 storyline where she temporarily leaves Jed any more than the rest of you, but I can easily overlook it, because she is almost uniformly a great character before and after that.

For all the criticism Sorkin gets for not writing women well, he created, imo, two of the best female television characters of the last twenty years in Abbey and the next character on the list.

- world building

- strong character development with talented actors

- interesting storylines that make you want to follow them to see where it goes

like this series does. The West Wing does *all* of the above perfectly. There's just no show like it. Most other political shows seem like cheap knockoffs in comparison (ie.

Given what I think these flags mean, and the speech that Mr Sorkin wrote for Isaac in ""The Six Southern Gentlemen of Tennessee"" (Sports Night) I was wondering if they appeared anywhere else, if he had had a change of heart or if these flags meant something else?

x----x

EDIT : Over night is has been pointed out by two comments that the flags apparently do not mean what they think I mean. My knowledge in this area is (I admit) somewhat sketchy, and I have only ever seen them linked to the Confederate flag - hence my confusion.

Apologies - then - for the suggestion in this, and the confusion in general about why Mr Sorkin had Bartlet speaking in front of one of them (in New Hampshire - which did not strike me as a bastion of The Confederate Army) and why Sam would hang one in his office.

As I said - I was just curious, and if we can't learn and ask questions, what else is this site for?",1

728,"20 Hours in America - is Josh getting a bad rap? During my rewatch (and subsequent listen to the West Wing Weekly take on it) the consensus seems to be that Donna is completely right in going off on Toby and Josh for their behavior during their ""planes, trains and automobiles"" odyssey.

*""I am not kidding. I have such an impulse to knock your heads together. I can't remember the last time I heard you two talk about anything other than how a campaign was playing in Washington. Cathy needed to take a second job so her dad could be covered by her insurance. She tried to tell you how bad things were for family farmers. You told her we already lost Indiana. You made fun of the fair but you didn't see they have livestock exhibitions and give prizes for the biggest tomato and the best heirloom apple. They're proud of what they grow. Eight modes of transportation, the kindness of six strangers, random conversations with twelve more, and nobody brought up Bartlet versus Ritchie but you. I'm writing letters, on your behalf to the parents of the kids who were killed today. Can I have the table, please?""*

To unpack this, in the opening scene in part 1, Josh seems to be listening to Cathy, while Toby is losing it about President Bartlet's delivery of the speech.  He solicits advice, and is trying to give examples of their struggles.  It's \*Toby\* that says that they were going to lose the state.  Josh didn't hear the bit about Cathy taking a second job for the insurance, because he was in the back of the truck with Cap and Toby.  Yes, he mentioned being briefed about the fair because he was anxious being out of touch, but it wasn't especially dismissive (for Josh, anyway).  And we saw - twice, although Donna only witnessed it once - people say that ""Didn't vote for \[Bartlet\] last time, don't plan on voting for him this time"", and Tyler's friends were also anti-Bartlet, so it wasn't just them talking about the election.  

In the meantime, Josh actually thanks Cathy and Cap, and Tyler.  His point in the running argument with Toby is trying to pay attention to the issues that matter to the voters and not making it about being the smartest kid in the class.  To win, not to beat down Ritchie.  

Yes, Josh does Josh-like things.  He puts his foot squarely in his mouth talking about Cathy to Cap.  He gets pretty racist when he talks about ""Mohammed al Mohammed al Mohammend bin Bizir"".  And apparently he's the reason they had to walk three blocks in the rain (although he did give Donna his coat).  And maybe this was Donna blowing off steam they way Josh and Toby had been all day, but she looks directly at Josh when it was Toby who was the source of most of their frustrations.

Then again, it led to the Matt Kelly scene, which was great and led to a great bit in ""College Kids""",1

754,"Dropped storylines. I'm doing my first rewatch of the West Wing after previously watching the whole show about ten years ago. Right now, I'm at the end of season 3. 

Everyone knows that Sorkin has a habit of dropping characters out of the blue. During this rewatch, I'm noticing his habit of dropping major storylines too. Or at least wrapping them up *way* too quickly. Allow me to give some examples. 

* The President's MS. The last five episodes of season two focus on the huge fallout it will cause when the world finds out. It ramps you up to expect an enormous fight that lasts a season. But within ten episodes, Bartlet has accepted the censure and any suggestion of repercussions basically end. The story is dropped, and the focus shifts completely to re-election. 

* Leo's addiction. Once again, they make a huge deal about how much of a fight Leo has on his hands. Then they cut a quick deal and the story is dropped. 

* The aftermath of the shooting is time-lapsed in one episode (midterms). I get why this did this from a story point of view, as you can't have Josh recovering for half a season. But it's one of the biggest events in the Bartlet administration, and it's pretty much skipped through. 

Other notable examples include the breakup of Leo's marriage, Sam's relationship with Laurie being exposed, and Josh's PTSD. 

Basically, I'm asking if anyone else has noticed Sorkin's habit of spending more time on the build-up than he does on the event itself? I'm not criticizing the show, by the way. It's just something I never noticed during my first run-through, and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way.

They compare 500 word-essays or whatever and Toby has will stop reading his because Will’s is much better.

To top it all off, will gives toby the letter from sam that says “he’s one of us.” The message is so simple but it almost made me cry because it’s somehow weirdly the best part of sam and toby’s friendship, how despite all their bickering, they’re the only two who truly understand each other, and now will is one of them.

768,"“And It’s Sure To Their Credit” (s2e5) - Tribbey and the Dead Flowers EDIT - obviously I meant “surely” up there...

I was looking at an old thread on the scene when Sam fires the two a-holes, and there’s always been a question in my mind about it. The way Tribbey jumps in with his “Oh yes. He can. Now leave here and don’t ever come back.” It seemed so ... strange and out of character for him. His tone of voice was so sarcastic (as it always was). And his most recent interaction with Ainsley was bad - he didn’t have any reason to come around to respecting her like the other staffers did. In fact, she called him out. 

Don’t hate on me for this - I know it doesn’t make total sense - But ever since the first time I saw the episode (when it aired), I’ve been under the impression that TRIBBEY left the dead flowers (not the two guys), and his “leave and never come back” was a cover. As Sam pointed out - no one signed the “Bitch” note. But also - Sam never actually tells them the reason he’s firing them, so they never actually confront him about it, confirm it, or deny it. And Tribbey supposedly has no idea what’s going on - ALL HE KNOWS (unless he knows more, already....) is that Sam is firing them, yet he abruptly jumps in to back him up without hearing anything about the dead flowers.

To me, watching it initially, it seemed so obvious that that was what was happening - That Tribbey left the flowers and found a perfect opportunity to get away with it, because he’s slimy and only cares about drinks with little umbrellas in them (“SHISH KABOB!”) It doesn’t seem like ANYONE else saw it that way, though...?",1

771,"Is Cliff Calley a good guy? I've been trying to listen to the West Wing Weekly episodes as close to concurrent as I can (watching episodes at night, listening to the episodes at work the next day) and I found Josh Malina's take in the episode for [H. Con-172](http://thewestwingweekly.com/episodes/310) , on Cliff ""helping"" Leo, to be interesting.  Cliff talks about waiting in the ""tall weeds"" for Gibson if he went after Leo in the hearing., but Malina suggests this is a way to save a bargaining chip for later, and that Cliff isn't a good guy at all.

My original take was more like Hrishi's in the episode, that Cliff is a good guy and is trying to make this go away.  But now I wonder if the truth is in the middle.  Going after Leo might have scored a few immediate political points, but would also make, as Cliff said, ""good people hate"" the Republicans.  If the end goal was always to censure the President, then it makes sense that Calley would try to use the threat of Leo's exposure to facilitate that end.   Especially if they knew what Ainsley found out, that the Administration was full of good, righteous people, and specifically what Cliff may have known from reading Donna's diary that no one actually knew.  Calley may have understood prolonged hearings would damage the Republicans even as it did in real life with the Clinton impeachment hearings.

This darker take might be the only way Joe Quincy is able to say what he did about Josh's PTSD connection to music - that it had been in Donna's diary and Calley let it drop at some point.  

I'm still inclined to think Cliff isn't a really bad guy, not nearly the person Josh Malina paints him to be, but I can see him being a bit more calculating that I originally thought.  I do think he had genuine affection for Donna, tho'.

775,"Finished first watch Just finished the season finale yesterday (well technically today at like 3am) and after I finished it, I just felt kinda empty. But now that I’ve had time to process it, I am feeling all of the emotions: happy, sad, overwhelmed. It was so bittersweet. 

I could spend a while talking about the finale, but I’ll just talk about my two favorite parts: Donna looking around her new office as Chief of Staff, and CJ leaving the White House. Those were both really amazing moments for me. Watching Donna grow as a person and work her way up to higher positions was one of my favorite storylines, and the look on CJs face when she told the man she didn’t work at the White House and walked away was satisfying. CJ was the first character that I liked and the only character that I’ve consistently liked through all 7 seasons. I’m so glad she ended up happy doing what she wanted to do. Oh, and Bartlet giving Charlie the constitution. That made me actually cry. 

With that being said, I wish the original group all had one last goodbye together in the Oval Office or something. Might’ve been cheesy, but I still would’ve wanted it. 

Starting this show, I wasn’t sure what to expect. You hear a show is critically acclaimed and think, “ok, this show has got a lot of praise from people. I’ll probably like it.”  This critically acclaimed show puts other critically acclaimed shows to shame. (Seriously, some shows should not be considered critically acclaimed.) I know a lot of people love this show because it gives them hope or it’s an escape from reality, and while that was true for me as well, what really got me hooked right away was the dialogue and acting. The dialogue is something else, like nothing I’ve seen in any other show. The acting was superb. I figured Martin Sheen and Allison Janney would be great since I’d seen their work before, but since I had never heard of anyone else I wasn’t sure what to expect of them. They didn’t disappoint either, especially Richard Schiff.  

While Sorkin’s era of this show was superior, I was so glad, and pleasantly surprised, that I still enjoyed s5-7 enough to keep watching.  I was scared I wouldn’t like it because of all the horrible reviews about s5 (unpopular opinion: it wasn’t that bad.)

This is a show I knew I would rewatch many times before I even finished it. I wanna rewatch it now, I’m already going through withdrawals, but I have some questions: should take a break before I rewatch it, or watch another Sorkin show? Also should I listen to west wing weekly? I’ve heard mixed reviews. 

(Edit: the only other show I would put on this level is FX’s “the Americans”. Both shows are different, but very extraordinary.)

The hair isn’t puffy, and it stays that way through the most of season 6, then reverts to the hair he has the rest of the seasons. It’s definitely shorter on the sides in the Supremes, and season 6 the back is shorter too.

I’ve though that maybe it was a commentary on having more time devoted to personal upkeep after leaving the White House, but it’s shorter before he leaves...and I know I’m overthinking.

784,My friends and I went through a fair bit in our lives in 2018. Decided to put together a late Christmas present for us all. ,1
785,"My idea for a 'West Wing' revival First off, I don't think it should be called the West Wing. We've seen the inside of a fictionalized White House for seven seasons, and it's unlikely (unless they want to take the perspective of a conservative staff) that there would be so many consecutive or near-consecutive terms of Democrats in the White House.    The new show should be called ""The Beltway.""

Second, while I would love for the old cast to have a role to play, the show cannot focus on them. At least not all of them.  A strong new cast of diverse actors/actresses need to be the center of the show.

As a reflection on our current times, the president occupying the White House is a Trump-like figure... maybe not to the same degree of incompetence and corruption (personal opinion), but in terms of a fascination with social media and waging a war on ""fake news.""

Modeling our present circumstances, Democrats have just gained the majority in the House and have voted Congresswoman CJ Craig to be the Speaker of the House. She ran for congress shortly after the flash-forward from the end of the series after the opening of Bartlet's presidential library reminded her of the impact policy-makers can have versus that of the private sector.   Donna Lyman is the head of the DNC and is struggling to maintain peace between establishment and populist factions within the party.   Charlie Young is a rising star in politics and is a freshman member of the House. He represents a more liberal side of the party and tends to clash occasionally with CJ over her more moderate approach/agenda.  Ainsley Hays is the current president's chief of staff - trying everything in her power to keep some order in the West Wing.   Sam Seaborn and Josh Lyman run a major DC consulting firm.  Their firm is contracted to run a team that will coordinate communication and strategy between the party institutions (DNC/DCCC/House/Senate) - the members of which will make up the new cast of the show.

One of many problems with this concept is that you can't  possibly match the stakes surrounding events that take place in the White House.  Several compelling episodes of the West Wing involved major national security events that directly involved the president.  Of course, nothing stops the show from eventually transitioning into a CJ Craig White House with several former associates brought in to run her staff.

Thoughts?

We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil.

The next scene is of President Bartlet and Abbie staring out of what is presumably Marine One’s window down at the field Zoey is located in. So the first part of my question is regarding the 25th. If Barlet had “Stepped Down” by invoking the 25th and we don’t see him re-sign the second letter until a couple scenes later, then how are they on Marine One without President Walken when they rescue Zoey? 

(For this one I’m actually curious would this really be allowed for a President who invoked the 25th while in office?)

I like how they were able to bring back so many guest stars, even if it was only for the funeral scene. Personally, I never really liked Amy, so I thought her scenes were a waste. I would’ve rather had her scenes be replaced with Ainsley. 

I’m kinda surprised that his funeral wasn’t held in the Washington National Cathedral like Mrs. Landingham’s. 

Charlie being shocked that Josh hadn’t offered Donna a job yet was great, but also not suprising, cause it’s Josh.  He better offer her a job. 

I loved the scene where Jed told the story about Margaret using a trash can as an umbrella for Leo and accidentally dumping food all over him. I also loved when they all went back up to the residence and shared stories about Leo. It was cute and funny and you could see that they were all deeply touched by him. It was just awkward to see Abbey look so uncomfortable when he was telling the stories. 

It must’ve been really surreal and sad for the cast to have buried John Spencer in real life, and then film an episode where they buried his character. Like I said in my last post, there was probably no need to dig up emotions. 

When I first started the show Leo was one of my favorites. It sad John Spencer couldn’t be around to finish this great series and see how it ended.

791,"The West Wing Sequel Concept... I was rewatching again and as we have now reached 2019, the 20th anniversary year of The West Wing, I need more episodes... so why not just pitch a sequel. 

Here goes:

We see a young woman in her late teens/early twenties.  Abruptly slamming her laptop shut, barely getting it into her backpack before she runs into a rainy DC. We see a tracking shot of her running out of a building near the national mall.

Cut to a large office building where we find Donna Moss, in a conference room with a large Santos Foundation logo and a table covered in paperwork. A TV is on tuned to MSNBC with her old boss Josh Lyman interviewed.

She unmutes:
 “... Nothing is worse than this. I can’t imagine an administration caught lying about something this crucial...”

The phone rings. She pauses the tv and hits her speakerphone. 
“Donna.”
“President Bartlet, is everything okay?”
“Everything’s fine Donna. Listen, in the next 15 minutes you’re gonna have a young woman showing up at your door.”
“Okay...”
“Hey Donna, you’re running for Congress?”
“Well Mr. President, I’m not sure I...”
“You should, and you should be sure about it!”
“Well thank your sir. I’m definitely considering my options.”
“Good. Good.”
“Um... Mr. President....This young woman?”
“Donna, she’s something special. I’ve been keeping an eye on her since... I guess, since she was born.”

A ruckus is heard at the front of the office. An employee approaches and tries to explain before Donna cuts her off.

“Let her in.”
A few seconds later see the young woman from before, now soaking wet:
“Donna, say hello to Cory Tolliver.”
“Thank you Mr. President. Hello Ms. Moss.”
“Donna, do yourself a favor and hire her.”
“Yes, Mr. President.”
The call disconnects as the two women stare at each other, trying to figure out what just happened.”

A few seconds pass, when Donna realizes.

“Ms. Tolliver, let’s take a walk.”

We flash forward to a walk and talk a couple of years later. Cory is now an assistant to Congresswoman Moss... we eventually weave story lines with original cast members and where they ended up in politics after the end of the original run and we see new story lines about current and past political events including Cory’s father Morris Tolliver’s death and the way she was raised (and mentored by the Bartlet family) and we learn her political motivations. 

This is Donna and Cory’s story now. How they can make it to The West Wing, and what happens once they make it there. ",1

793,Josh and Therapists named Stanley So I apologize if this has been posted before... but I feel like such a ditz that on my 18th rewatch of the 1st season I realized that the therapist Josh sees in the “Crackpots and these Women” is named Stanley - which obviously is the same first name as the ATVA therapist that later treats Josh and President Bartlett - Stanley Keyworth. Odd they couldn’t think of a new first name for a therapist... with the exception of the fake therapist Dr. Jenna Jacobs (definitely one of my top 50 favorite scenes),1
794,Why was Leo fired for disagreeing with the Israel-Palestine negotiations? It seems like a bit of an overreaction. Is this literally the first time the two have disagreed on something?

I wasn’t sure if I would cause I heard some people thought they didn’t handle Leo’s death well or that the acting felt numb or something.

They had just lost one of their coworkers/friends in real life!)

It’s assumed Santos has an illegitimate child but it turns out to be his brother’s child, and Santos stepped up and decided to pay the child support for him. At the end of the episode when Vinick gives Santos back his briefcase, he tells Santos that this information will get out and that the public deserves to know the truth. Which begs my question: How much personal information should a presidential candidate share to the public? Do they have obligation to tell the public every detail of their personal life? Personally, I don’t think Santos should tell, not only because it would cause a scandal and make him look bad, but because it’s really none of the public’s business, and, unlike Bartlet’s MS, wouldn’t directly affect his ability to do his job.

If elected, how does that play out, without that derailing their agenda?

I thought maybe it has changed since the show aired, but then I remembered in the Clinton Affair (recent documentary) Monica Lewinsky mentions that there was a door that led to pres’ private study. While in the show it’s Leo’s office.

I finished it really quickly (again) and felt that hollowness that you get once you finish so I decided to watch another presidential type show to keep me (kind of) in the white house zone.    

For some reason I decided to watch Designated survivor. Although it's kind of....a bit shit... I think the story idea of it is fantastic, I only wish sorkin wrote the plot.    

One thing that annoys me is the utter disregard the show has for proper white house procedure and unrealistic presidential priorities (like not even think about naming a VP immedi after the explosion), or the secret service allowing the president to slip away ""from the office"" with only one secret service agent to watch his estranged son play the violin etc.....

But what annoys me the most, is that it stole some of sorkins lines and ideas. They were poorly executed but still... I don't think it's very fair...or maybe it is, after all good writers borrow from other writers, great writers steal from them outright.    

I have to be truthful with what I'm saying so although the show winds me up, I can't stop watching it for the cheesey conspiracy involved.   

It's like the west wing is some relatively unknown jazz band from the 50s who pioneered many forms of jazz that evolved into other, more modern genres and Designated survivor is a cheesey pop Club tune that has no depth or substance but you can't help agreeing is catchy, I'm really annoyed with myself but also enjoying, hence the weird experience.

I must have blocked the bit out where both Josh and Will want to use Baker's wife's depression against him, because I do not remember it happening at all. It made me like Santos more that he forbade Josh from using it, and Donna more because she tried to get Will not to do it, but I think it ranks up there as one of the worst things anyone on the show has ever done. 

Especially coming from Josh, who was outraged that Leo's drug and alcohol abuse came out in public, and Leo clearly had far more power than a potential First Lady would. Do they mention this instance again at some point or are we just stuck knowing that Josh and Will are morally repugnant?",1

2. Oregon is said to have been been decided by around a couple of thousand votes, yet Nevada was the state that got more attention, even though there was a 30,000 vote margin (which isn't super close in Nevada terms). Is this something to do with Oregon's all-mail balloting system?

In the spirit of the relationship threads for Josh and C.J., I'd like to propose a discussion of his love life.  He was engaged when he joins the Bartlet Team, and he's engaged when he joins the Santos Administration, but I think this is really a two horse race with two women he doesn't (seem to) end up with.

5. Lisa Sherborne - writer for Vanity Fair, the ex-fiancée.  You can see flashes of what might have been there during ""100,000 Airplanes"", but Sam says that she didn't like him very much.

4. Unnamed Fiancée - Nothing really to go on.  We know she's a lawyer, we know she seems to be OK with him taking the Deputy CoS job.  So apparently they talk, which would rank her ahead of Lisa.

3. Laurie - I don't care for the Laurie subplot, but the writers did show that two cared for one another.  It might be interesting if she somehow ended up being the unnamed fiancée, but that's unlikely.  Her former profession would be an albatross around the neck of both Sam and the administration.

2. Mallory O'Brien - This was hard.  I love Sam &amp; Mallory.  Allison Smith was great and had great chemistry with Rob Lowe.  Ultimately, I think it was doomed.  She never seemed to get the life of devotion required, even when the President and Leo tried to explain it to her.  She would have left Sam just like her mother left Leo.  But it would've been fun for a while.

1. Ainsley Hayes - It's a shame Emily Procter got the *CSI:Miami* gig.  She and Lowe were dynamite together, and Ainsley brought a different dynamic to the show, and might have been a great venue to explore conservative viewpoints.  It would have been interesting in the mythical season 8 how they would've dealt with her and Sam, because the sparks would keep flying.

But weirdly, it was in this role that he left a lasting impression on me, because he refused to start World War III without knowing why. Without knowing if it was real, why they were doing it, why they were killing millions of people.

WarGames is a truly phenomenal movie for so many reasons and this is definitely one of them.

Curious what others think. I kind of get it: he's becoming more invested in the idea of a legacy, and that's nothing to scoff at, but that whole arc seems odd to me in many ways.

However, they disagree on who to run in the next elections. Factions are created and we watch as they pit candidates against each other to be the Democratic nominee. The season will also show the republican White House as it scrambles to prepare for the upcoming fight. My vote is Seaborn for presidency.

2. Donna Moss - Obviously an easy favorite, but because she was his protege and he a mentor, it seemed a little awkward.  Plus, I always felt he thought he was better than her and couldn't shake it.    They always seemed like high school sweethearts but with Josh, he was always focused in his career.  They probably could have had a couple of good years, Josh divorces her because he is too focused on work.
3. Amy Gardner - she is fun and devious at the same time.  It is off and on for several years.  Maybe they get married and have kids.  She eventually divorces him in some public scandal but it is actually a conspiracy started by Amy and Josh has to rebuild up his career.

I don't knows, I always saw these connections in this way with Joey as the front-runner.

It was such a passive choice, almost as if the administration gave up. This was an important appointment given the President’s health concern and it essentially elevated a no name congressman to the national stage. I seem to remember that after President Bartlet told Leo that Russell would be the nominee, he was visibly frustrated and didn’t even bother telling the staff. He just went off to bed.

Anyone else think this was out of character for the President, Leo, Toby, Josh, etc.? Seems like they bent over backwards to please the Republicans for something as important as the VP.

I prefer the headcanon that Leo gave C.J.'s name to President Bartlet over Josh's because he needed Josh out on the campaign trail finding a successor, but I feel the skill set we're presented for Josh doesn't seem to translate to the next level.  He's got the knowledge of domestic issues, certainly, and he's generally absorbed the right procedure for things, but he's never been in the Situation Room and he thinks of Italy as the ""one that looks like a boot"".  

What's worse, we never see Josh being good with people, particularly from a leadership standpoint.  His complete flub of the rally &amp; thank the troops moment in ""Election Day"" would concern me greatly.  There's no sense that any of his staff will have anything close to the loyalty that Leo enjoyed.  He has Sam, and then has has people like Amy &amp; Lou who he's had to fight more than he's worked with.

I keep coming back to the advice Bartlet gave Secretary Tribbey during the State of the Union, when he was ""the guy"" - that your Chief of Staff should be your best friend, and that isn't Josh for Matt Santos.  They go head to head on most issues, and with Kazakhstan possibly derailing the first 100 days, I can only see that tension increasing.

I also feel the loss of Leo was never fully explored for Josh.  Going back to Donna's comments to Amy in ""Commencement"", about his biggest fear being losing people he loves and it being his fault, this is another huge hit to his mental health.  His deterioration during ""Transition"" could even been looked at as a PTSD relapse, with his explosion at Otto somewhat equivalent to putting his hand through the glass.  (Which makes me wonder about Donna and her lying to Santos - she had to know that Josh had never been this bad, right?  Was she downplaying his status so Santos wouldn't think he couldn't do the job or did she literally not see how bad he was - was it that she didn't want to see it?)

Anyhow,,, I don’t know a ton about US politics but I feel like I’m learning a lot through the show and also feel like I’m constantly comparing how I think the current Administration would handle events that happen in the show.

I’m not sure where I’m going with this, as it’s super late and I have put off,,, a ton of my homework to read 2010 AV Club reviews for the episodes I binged :P 

Edit: I guess I’m wondering, if you watch the show now, do you feel the same way? Has your opinion of the show changed based on who was president at the time you watched it? Does rewatching it make you aware of things you weren’t before?",1

927,"Couple of random questions after watching again I watched the show again and these questions are getting to me.  They are kind of random and focus on last seasons.

\- In the later seasons, I was really confused between the role of Hoynes and Russell (they looked so much alike).  Anyway, what did Will do during that time.  Did  he work for the President, both Vice Presidents.  Sometimes at the same time?   How was he able to get so much access with the President's staff when he was working for the Vice President?

\- Harper was  Deputy National Security Advisor ?, she seemed to have a lot of influence when in the situation room.  Is this normal in real life?    Also, she seemed kind of young  to be a commander and Deputy NSA advisor, could that happen?

\- What is the role of White House Counsel?  Especially towards the end with the leak.  I guess to protect the White House.  But what if something in the White House violates the law, do they have to keep silent or does the counsel have to report the illegality?     There is one scene with a WH leaker, does the leaker have to cooperate with White House counsel at all?

\- What happened to Zoe after she was captured.  There were a lot of holes there.  They could have done several episodes just going over the timeline of the capture and afterwards.

Random thoughts on the show, there were good episodes and better episodes.   Josh was amazing and hilarious in every episode, I can't think of a bad Josh scene.  He saved season 6 and 7.    Bartlett wasn't hilarious but loved when he was on the soap box.    For the me the best scenes were the serious ones with the situation room.    They could have done a whole spin-off show just on that.",1

933,"Discussion: Season 7, episode 7 - ""The Debate"" I watched today the debate episode and have mixed opinions about it. So I will try to list some points and them we discuss:

* With the exception of seconds of background before they entered in the stage the entire episode was shot as a real televised debate. Seems strange to me this choice of Alex Graves because on all the seasons we see the opposite: a lot of background and very little of the debates, speeches and interviews aired. We never got to watch Zoey entire interview after being kidnapped or the President and the First Lady disclosing the MS in the interview.

* The writing of Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr. in this episode is inconstant. I love the dialogues, researched arguments  defended well, a lot of quips and insights. But the whole premise fails to me, I couldn't believe that the moderator would be so willing to forget the rules and also do no understand the reason Vinick would do something so boldy without consulting Sheila.

* Matt interrupts a lot Vinick. And the moderator only accepted the changes in the debate if he could control both candidates. I thought the moderator was too weak.

* Jimmy Smits was great, but Alan Alda absolutely stoled this episode. He was incredible, his character was very real and I really enjoyed his perfomance.

What do you think about this episode? I would love to hear more opinions.

935,"Am I the only one who doesn't like season 3? I'm almost finished with my first run-through of the series (just started season seven today). Seasons 1-2 are my favorites, season 4 is okay, season 5 was boring, and I'm actually enjoying seasons 6-7 (the campaign angle gave the series a breath of fresh air, I thought). But the one season that I really did not like was season 3.

Ignoring the two special episodes (which I do) the season just didn't live up to my expectations. We ended season two with Bartlet pausing before he answered the reelection question, and then season three begins with everything seemingly all over the place. The whole ""did Bartlet lie about his MS plot?"" would have been good if it didn't end as abruptly as it did (I thought the way it ended was such a cop-out, too). New characters Babish and Bruno I just could not stand - Bruno got on my nerves all the time (though part of me thinks that was the point) and there was something about Babish I didn't like. Funnily enough, I actually don't mind them in season 7 (probably because we don't see them as often). And truthfully, I can barely remember any episodes from the season.

Anybody else feel this way about the third season?",1

Why after the show she didn't got good work opportunities like the rest of the cast?",1

941,"John Wells and his crew fundamentally misunderstood The West Wing I've posted here before about how I've really [had trouble with season 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/61wyln/season_5/). Listening to The West Wing Weekly's episode on 'Memorial' helped me get to an epiphany about why. Josh and Hrishi to their credit enjoyed season 5 and were quite even handed with their comments. At one point they mentioned how Season 5 has been lacking 'Deus Ex Machina' resolutions that Aaron Sorkin would use. During that section they also commented that Sorkin's West Wing was a ""fairy tale"" and how John Wells' version was not.

I agree entirely and that, in my opinion, is the problem.

John Wells decided to give us just another TV show where the characters squabble and their ideals are crushed by the burdens of everyday life. Sorkin gave us an idealistic show that showed the absolute best that motivated people could achieve. Yes, it was light-hearted and showed unlikely situations like conflicts between the POTUS and CoS resolving overnight. 

But that's what made it wonderful.

It wasn't the depressing drudgery that politics can sometimes be. Even in loss, Sorkin's White House maintained its composure and plowed ahead while Wells' ruminates in the juices of its disappointment. It's just not the show that hooked me. Yes, the fact that POTUS and Leo are best of friends through thick and thin with no prolonged arguments is unrealistic. But that is what made the show special. It showed us what could be and what we can aspire to. ""A more perfect life"" if you will. It's inspiring.

No surprise then that some of the best moments in season 5 are the ones with the deus ex machinas like the Republican caucus delaying long enough for the President to walk away, scoring him a political win. Or Josh coming up with the genius solution of placing two justices from ideologically opposite ends of the spectrum (who are conveniently already good friends).

Let's be honest, Wells' West Wing is still far superior to 99% of other TV but it misses why people enjoyed the show that came before it.

945,"So we got to Isaac and Ishamael Me again. Newbie. Still in awe of this goddamn show and I need somewhere to put these feelings since no one else I know watches this show and you’re now my unwilling audience. (Trust me, that will be rectified soon.)

So the season three opener. The first episode after 9/11. I sort of knew something like this was coming, bc of the time period, I just really wasn’t expecting it to be... this. The conversation Josh, Toby, Sam and CJ have with those high school kids in the mess, is perhaps, one of my favourite scenes of the episode. It’s not only the topics — Sam talking about terrorism’s failure rate, Josh’s SAT inspired question for those students, Toby talking about his Dad’s friend who was praying, CJ discussing the intelligence community — but the imagery of these four insanely smart, powerful political figures who literally got a President elected giving this impromptu forum to the next generation? And the juxtaposed with Leo’s questioning, being brutal and bitter and moderately prejudiced?

I’ve read reviews that say this episode was preachy and pointless and it didn’t plain work after the S2 finale but ya know what? I think it does. I think putting this in an episode where the characters are all incredibly liberal, and still showing their divergent, complex, confusing beliefs in a form and questioning setting — I think that works. I think it sends the message that just because you’re right on some things, doesn’t mean you’re right on all things.

Then again I could be wrong — I am the newbie around these parts!",1
946,"What was President Bartlett's unofficial policy with the press on issues involving his daughters? (Specific Reference) It's been a while since I've watched the West Wing. I seem to remember a scene in which President Bartlett got super pissed off at a member of the Press Corp that was asking personal questions about his daughters/ approached his daughter with questions without asking the administration officially. 

If I recall correctly, Josiah has this journalists ""Press Credentials"" pulled, though I believe it was done through unofficial channels with the network/ newspaper the guy worked for. This, in turn led to the network/ newspaper replacing the previous journalist with one that was much more critical of the Bartlett Administration. 

Am I mixing up shows? What episode was this in? With the whole Acosta thing going on right now, it reminded me of this so I was hoping to go back and find the episode, but I can't find it and I don't have time to watch the entire series again.
