So far I'm loving Jeff Daniels but I'm having some issues with the Maggie and a little bit with the Mac character. I dunno if it's a Sorkin thing but I can't really stand either of them when they're on the screen. They just seem so spazzy all the time. Is that going to change? I literally had to turn off the show during episode 3 (I think) because it was border like obnoxious.,0, just started watching it and have a few question i m a huge sorkin fan and recently picked up this show to watch so far i m loving jeff daniel but i m having some issue with the maggie and a little bit with the mac character i dunno if it s a sorkin thing but i can t really stand either of them when they re on the screen they just seem so spazzy all the time is that going to change i literally had to turn off the show during episode 3 i think because it wa border like obnoxious, just start watch it and have a few question i m a huge sorkin fan and recent pick up thi show to watch so far i m love jeff daniel but i m have some issu with the maggi and a littl bit with the mac charact i dunno if it s a sorkin thing but i can t realli stand either of them when they re on the screen they just seem so spazzi all the time is that go to chang i liter had to turn off the show dure episod 3 i think becaus it wa border like obnoxi

29,"[SPOILER] Everything wrong with the Operation: Genoa story arc. SPOILER: So the gist of the entire second season of the Newsroom was like this: The entire news team went on air with a damning story about an alleged war crime committed by the US government, but without actually confirming anything in the evidence. They based their entire investigation on assumption and secondhand information. And the  plot twists that exposed the lie and brought the story and characters down were contrived and thrown in out of nowhere. The soldier having a TBI, The mission manifest having secret ink on the paper because a vindictive guy (who we don't know) who had a drug addict son who killed himself (who we also don't know) and blames Charlie (which is stupid) . The obvious plot hole of Jim recommending Jerry take his place, but then says he doesn't know who Jerry is. And then Will's source happens to be the same vindictive guy, yet Will decides not to say anything? The thing about it all is. The Genoa story would've immediately been invalidated without MacKenzie resorting to checking the interview footage that showed the altered shot clock in the basketball game perpetrated by Jerry Dantana. The characters simply suspended simple reasoning when it came to looking over and qualifying the Genoa, and the writers overlooked what would actually happen if a news organization actually reported a story like Genoa.

&amp;#x200B;

But here are the main observations that I noticed that need to be conveyed on why the Genoa arc was so poorly written:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Charlie Skinner and the manifest. Yes the manifest had the invisible ink that enemy dude who wanted revenge on Charlie put on it (which is very contrived and poor writing). Let's be clear: Charlie didn't verify anything on that manifest and decided to run the Genoa report. He saw a vague code on the item list, and immediately just believed it was the sarin gas. And Charlie said he took the manifest to different quartermasters to verify its authenticity. How is it not one of those quartermasters caught the invisible ink ploy? Going on the premise that he believed it was an authentic mission manifest, he still didn't verify the mysterious item as the sarin gas. This was poor reporting. Charlie Skinner is who I shoulder most of the blame of the downfall of ACN over Genoa. I think the writers in season 2 didn't really pay attention to the kind of man Charlie Skinner is, because during season 2 Charlie seems to have suspended all his principles and reasoning that he laid on thick in the first season. In the first season Charlie was a very principled journalist in how news stories were to be reported. He was filtering about information presented to him, even if it was beyond doubt. During the episode where Sloan Sabath conducted the news in Japanese over the Fukashima crisis, he immediately shouted her down like a huge asshole in the middle of the newsroom in the most berating way possible. ""WE DON'T REPORT ON WHAT YOU THINK, SLOAN!!!""  And even calling for an elaborate investigation of all her past work because he thinks she's no longer credible as a reporter? Then he meets the old NSA guy about Reese secretly hacking phones. The news team confirms he's a legitimate NSA analyst, but Charlie brushes him off because his security clearance got downgraded, so Charlie feels the story will be contaminated using him. But in season 2, the OSI guy who had a stupid secret revenge plot against Charlie, hands him this manifest and gives some vague inferences about a mission, and Charlie just accepts it. Doesn't question him at all. Yet NSA guy getting downgraded for prostitution gets overlooked. Hell, even during Red Team III he says ""I BELIEVE IT'S THE SARIN"", not ""I CONFIRMED IT'S THE SARIN."" Charlie reported on what he believed, which makes him the most out of character of the season. 
2. The hamni8 tweet. One of the factors of the Genoa investigation was this fictional twitter. It turned out the the user's cell plan ran out, but the news team decided to believe he was killed during Genoa. Since Neal was behind investigating that, why didn't he figure that out? He found out the internet troll who was stalking Will in season 1 which is why he had a bodyguard. But more to the point, the news team had no information on the identity of who hamni8 even was, but yet was deemed credible for evidence for Genoa? No name or contact info. The problem I have with this is, in season 1, during the Egyptian revolution episode, Neal had a friend in Egypt willing to go out and film the events because Elliot was injured. MacKenzie on the other hand tells the informant that he needs to reveal his name and face, or otherwise the story won't have credibility. In which case I yelled at the TV ""But it does have credibility, he's f@#king there filming the Egyptian riots!"" The informant, Khalid, complies and reveals himself and gets captured by forces. Yet a twitter handle by an unknown person is perfectly suitable evidence. When Neal told the lawyers in the meeting ""I am not credible to judge the evidence"" I agree. And there was no evidence and certainly no judging being done by any of the characters involved.
3. The interview with the marine general. MacKenzie and Charlie meet a marine general they used as a key witness for Genoa. The marine general immediately figured out they were talking about sarin when discussing the Genoa mission. He agrees to do the interview, so obviously he's going to expect a question about if sarin was used in Genoa. So when Jerry Dantana directly asked him ""was sarin used in Genoa?"" the marine general decides to be stupid and answers ""if we used sarin...""  I yell at the TV even louder ""SIMPLY ANSWER NO!!!!"" Are the serious with this? A competent military executive would not open himself up with ""if we used"". He expected the question, he should've directly answered ""No"" and stuck with ""No"", not explain the logisitics of sarin, or ""if we used sarin."" He basically asked to be edited out of context. 
4. The pacing of the fallout of Genoa. After Genoa airs, the newsroom seems awfully quiet. The report got millions of viewers as Charlie reports to Will. The characters are seen sitting around waiting for a response from the government. But if this was reality now, upon watching the Genoa report, every other news organization in the world would be on the phone with ACN picking the Genoa story apart. Every news organization would've called their military and government sources to confirm Genoa, and then call ACN and ask what the hell did they just report? It would be a high stress and noisy newsroom with phones ringing every minute, not quiet and business as usual. They wouldn't even get to the meeting where everyone agrees to stick with the Genoa story. Genoa would've fallen much sooner. And Jerry Dantana revealing the TBI and that the solider lied about it, and that Maggie wasn't in the room. No serious journalist would've backed down from jerry's defensive tirade. I was waiting for Charlie to immediately call for an investigation of Jerry's reporting like he threatened with Sloan. Again characters not being logical.

I'm trying to catch up to the rewatch thread... in Newsnight 2.0, Will gets a gift basket from his upstairs neighbors as an apology for the whole ""ceiling falling on you"" thing.

70,"Just finished binging this for the first time [spoilers] My girlfriend loved it and I’ve heard good things so I jumped right in.

For me season 1 was by far the best. I liked the structure of each episode revolving around a major news story. Getting a handle on the different jobs and how everyone works to put the story on the air was fascinating.

Season 2 somewhat abandons that structure. While I did enjoy it overall, I found myself getting a little irritated at all of the romantic subplots. The only one I really bought into was Will and Mack’s. It wasn’t trying to be a screwball comedy but seemed to be about real people managing real issues.

Season 3 was really hit and miss for me. Maybe it was the fact that it was only 6 episodes but something about it just didn’t flow. Everything sort of seemed half developed: the sale of ACN, Jim confesses his love to Maggie. Will ending up in prison seemed like a stretch considering the screenplay re-emphasized every few minutes that reporters rarely go to jail for not revealing their sources.

All in all I enjoyed it but unfortunately I felt it peaked in season 1. I was invested in the characters and that carried me through to the end but it dropped off rather quickly.

72,"Regarding Will being a republican. The narrative that mainstream media seems to always want to dole out [Trevor Noah, Colbert report and at times, John Oliver] is that Republicans are ignorant, backwards people who want to kill all immigrants, gays and want your babies to be armed with guns right after birth.  
  
The Newsroom as well as my eventually being fed up with the narrative makes me think that that is not what Republicans are about. This in turn has made me want to find real republican shows that are more logical but's hard to find any show that is like those comedy stuff that I mentioned above and is republican.  
  
When I say is real republican, I am referring to the Republicans that is described Will in the episode where he basically rants to Charlie something about republican of today not representing what it originally was and how it was hijacked by the tea party to become what it is, which basically seems to just be the political party that always seems wrong on every major issue, even some that shouldn't be bipartisan issues.

77,"Was this not a fairly significant plot hole in the series finale? I've been looking at a bunch of episodes yet again for the umpteenth time when this occurred to me. Now, I could understand if there was a certain amount of the fandom that wasn't thrilled with the season 3 aka series finale. With all the flashback stuff they put in, that it might've been putting a kind of finer point on the series as a whole than what was needed.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's one particular thing that, far as I can tell, ends up playing as a hard, direct contradiction to what we'd known previously. Of course so much of the drama during season 1 comes from how antagonistic Leona Lansing is toward Will and what they're trying to do on the show once Mac comes back. That she's put off by how Will is genuinely trying to make politicians and other big shots accountable for their behavior (especially it being people whose political help she may need).  In 01x03 in the board room meeting with Charlie, she even says *""What happened to breast cancer, all the human interest stuff? He was great at that shit!""*... *""He was sleeping while doing that shit.""*... *""And whose idea was it to wake him up?""*

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, makes for a compelling face off between two strong personalities during that scene, but here's the problem: during the series finale, we're shown in the flashbacks a moment where Will is still down at Barbados (or whatever island resort he was at) on his vacation after the Northwestern incident, but before he's returned to work. He receives a call at the bar from Leona, her asking him if he's okay, basically making sure he's not having a nervous breakdown or anything. Will says in a very calm, but matter-of-fact way, *""Leona, I'd like to actually finally do the news""*. To which Leona replies ***""So who's stopping you?""*** and then she hangs up.

I love the setup, the characters, the writing, and it amazes me how pertinent some of the stuff still is. 

However, above all, what I love the most is Mackenzie Mchale. Emily Mortimer does a fantastic and beautiful job of brining this character to life imo. I can not get enough of her relationship to Will. I love the back and forth, her 'cuteness', and the ultimate love between them. (I can just sense its coming). As the character said about herself, she is 'beautiful, intelligent, and vital'. Kinda makes me jealous, which I had someone like that...(woah, sorry, that topic is for another day)

Anyway, I can't believe the show is so short. I was really bummed to find out that it is only 2.5 seasons, and apparently a lot of stuff went down, that led to it being 'cancelled'

But wouldn’t it be nice. If the news group, cast and crew made a single follow up episode each year. They could pick all kinds of new topics to report on from through out the year. We could get a quick update on there lives and where they are at now. Some things have changed, some things never change.

116,"Blown fact check You know something absolutely minor that bugs the shit out of me, and has since the first time I watched it the first time it aired on HBO like 4 years ago.

In Season 3, when Will and Mac and Charlie and the lawyer go before the government lawyer, and the govt lawyer makes a point to say Nebraska didn't recruit him so he had to go to Texas A&amp;M instead, and the implication is this is for football (strongly because of the guy's size and shape, and because the only sport that matters at Nebraska and A&amp;M is football).  He says he lost to Nebraska all 4 years he was there, and that he hated it (to which Will quips ""really I thought you would have gotten used to it."")  We all know that The Newsroom is a fictional news network with fictional people that exists in our reality; that everything is the same other than these people and this network exist and this is how the cover news, act, interact, etc.

Never, at any point in history, have Nebraska and Texas A&amp;M played each other 4 straight years.  Yes, they were both in the Big XII for awhile, but when they were in the Big XII they were in different divisions and at most played each other twice in 4 years.  And more than that, based on the implied ages of these characters, they would have been at these respective schools long before the Big XII was formed (which was like 1996).

This is minor, and borderline meaningless, but also stupid that they couldn't get it right.  For as much as I LOVE this show, and am now finishing up probably my 5th watch-through of it, it's annoying they couldn't get this right.  It's a detail so simple, I'm amazed not one person on the writing team said anything.  All they would've had to do is change Texas A&amp;M to Oklahoma, one of Nebraska's historical rivals for about 60 years up until 2010 or so.

It has annoyed me for years, and now I'm sharing it with you all.  It's 1:24am central time, and I have a sleeping 16-month old, and I have work in 7 hours.

120,"[Season Three Episode Five] - (Spoilers) When Will was in prison, was he hallucinating? I just rewatched the episode for the third time, and noticed something new. Will has three pictures on the wall; one of Mac, one of the entire gang, and one of young will and his father. During the episode, Will is sharing a prison cell with another man. He has many deep discussions with the man, who knows lots about will. The man even knows that Will was beaten by his father at a young age. 
I thought this was just a coincidence, but at the end of the episode it cuts to will taking down the pictures, and it is revealed his father in the picture was the same man in the cell. 
Then, I looked up the post show interview on HBO with Sorkin, where he reveals that it was Will’s father all along.
So yes- will was hallucinating that he was seeing his dad after over 50 days in solitary. I feel like this is an amazing piece of writing by Sorkin and staff, as it was a physical interpretation of the main conflict within Will over the 2.5 previous seasons.

129,"the lawywr is terrible In season 2 and the staff keeps getting into trouble over things Jerry is trying to do to get them to settle.

As a lawyer who said she is looking at a 17 million dollar apartment and is obviously successful and good at what she does presumebly why does she not prep the staff for potential trouble they can into by saying or doing certain things by predicting the legal strategies by Jerry and his lawyers?

I've worked with many corporate lawyers and they spend a lot of time addressing possible outcomes and instructing clients what to watch out for.

An example is when Jerry calls for a job reference knowing they'll give a terrible one and in not warning them about this strategy they get sued again.

There may be earlier instances, but there are plenty of later ones that come before BlackBerry released the 9900 line in November of that year. When I saw her holding one, it stuck out to me as quite odd.

159,"I don't think Sorkin ever read Don Quixote Okay, this is not a complete argument or even a complete thought, but stay with me. I'm 18, so I was (fairly) young when Newsroom first aired. Since it went off, I actually read Don Quixote by Cervantes and absolutely loved it. Changed my life.

Now I'm rewatching, and they get a lot of things wrong! From what I can gather, it seems like every Don Quixote reference is really just a reference to the musical ""Man of La Mancha"", which isn't really an adaptation but more of a story about the story.

In the pilot, Will corrects Mac by pointing out she had quoted the musical, not the book. But seconds later he corrects her statement on his steed by saying he rode a donkey, not a horse. This isn't true, he rode a horse named Rocinante (Sancho rode a donkey). He even reiterates this later with Charlie.

In a later episode (S1E10), Will talks about how Quixote was defeated by the Knight of the Mirrors, as he showed the protagonist who he really was. This happens in the musical, but in the book the Knight of the Mirrors is actually defeated by Quixote and is in fact also a man dressed in fake armor. At the end of the episode he gets up from the hospital bed reciting the words ""What is illness to the body of our knight errant? What matter wounds?"" and Charlie says he's reciting the end of Don Quixote.

Nope. It's from the musical.

Now obviously none of this is of consequence, the show is still compelling and I appreciate the references. And who knows, maybe it's the characters just fucking up. But it's become a small peeve that it seems as though Sorkin (a known musical theater fan) is making references to classic literature, only using knowledge from the musical ""adaptation"".

And I guess I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy.

163,"the voter ID laws in the greater fool confused me... when they investigate the voter ID laws that were passed to ensure that only people who were actually citizens of America could vote, they portray it as a negative thing. They went on to say that its being implemented with an agenda of making sure certain citizens who's votes arent what some candidates want cant vote.  
  
I am confused on why certain citizens dont have govt ID. in the episode they used the case of an elderly Tennesse resident who cant vote because she doesnt have a passport because she never planned to travel overseas and doesnt have a drivers license because she never learned to drive. in Canada, at least in British Columbia, we have 2 different govt IDs that we can use for identification besides a drivers' license or a passport. BCID which as the name suggests is is just a card to provide a person with a govt ID in case they dont have a license as well as the card we use for Medical Services Plan which is tied to our Medical information [ie health insurance and so forth]. Ive never seen someone who doesn't have some type of identification and even my grandmother who indeed never learned to drive and doesnt use her passport for day to day ID still has a BCID and the Medical Services Card just for day to day identification purposes.  
  
Which makes me wonder if its fair of this Tennesse woman to be upset that she cant vote when to me it seems like its actually her fault because she never bothered to get the proper ID. unless, in America, or Tennessee, they dont have the same ability to get a govt ID that isnt tied to their driving capacity?",0, the voter id law in the greater fool confused me when they investigate the voter id law that were passed to ensure that only people who were actually citizen of america could vote they portray it a a negative thing they went on to say that it being implemented with an agenda of making sure certain citizen who s vote arent what some candidate want cant vote i am confused on why certain citizen dont have govt id in the episode they used the case of an elderly tennesse resident who cant vote because she doesnt have a passport because she never planned to travel overseas and doesnt have a driver license because she never learned to drive in canada at least in british columbia we have 2 different govt id that we can use for identification besides a driver license or a passport bcid which a the name suggests is is just a card to provide a person with a govt id in case they dont have a license a well a the card we use for medical service plan which is tied to our medical information ie health insurance and so forth ive never seen someone who doesn t have some type of identification and even my grandmother who indeed never learned to drive and doesnt use her passport for day to day id still ha a bcid and the medical service card just for day to day identification purpose which make me wonder if it fair of this tennesse woman to be upset that she cant vote when to me it seems like it actually her fault because she never bothered to get the proper id unless in america or tennessee they dont have the same ability to get a govt id that isnt tied to their driving capacity, the voter id law in the greater fool confus me when they investig the voter id law that were pass to ensur that onli peopl who were actual citizen of america could vote they portray it as a neg thing they went on to say that it be implement with an agenda of make sure certain citizen who s vote arent what some candid want cant vote i am confus on whi certain citizen dont have govt id in the episod they use the case of an elderli tenness resid who cant vote becaus she doesnt have a passport becaus she never plan to travel oversea and doesnt have a driver licens becaus she never learn to drive in canada at least in british columbia we have 2 differ govt id that we can use for identif besid a driver licens or a passport bcid which as the name suggest is is just a card to provid a person with a govt id in case they dont have a licens as well as the card we use for medic servic plan which is tie to our medic inform ie health insur and so forth ive never seen someon who doesn t have some type of identif and even my grandmoth who inde never learn to drive and doesnt use her passport for day to day id still ha a bcid and the medic servic card just for day to day identif purpos which make me wonder if it fair of thi tenness woman to be upset that she cant vote when to me it seem like it actual her fault becaus she never bother to get the proper id unless in america or tennesse they dont have the same abil to get a govt id that isnt tie to their drive capac

174,"Can someone tell me what Sorkin did wrong in Oh Shenandoah? This episode is incredibly controversial because of the conversations between Don and Mary, but for the life of me I do not know why. 
Mary is right about the pamphlets, about the advice, she has an answer for everything Don says. Don points out there are two sides, that allowing anonymous posts on the internet that accuse people of heinous crimes sets a dangerous precedent (which I think has been proven repeatedly since then) and Mary responds with her point of view - that it is a public service, that she feels she has a duty. She even admits it might be used for revenge - a fake story - but she believes it is still worth it. 
He also tries to protect her from being humiliated on national television (and does anyone think that her facing off against her rapist would end well for her?) and points out that if we believe accused murderers get the benefit of the doubt, why not accused rapists?
Given that Sorkin is credited as the chief writer, it is likely he wrote both sides of the dialog, so while he wrote Don's lines, he also wrote Mary's. 
I have watched this a dozen times, and I cannot see what he did wrong. Given that the show is all about presenting both sides of a story, that News Night 2.0 is about presenting facts (which both Don and Mary do) and letting the audience (in this case - us) decide for themselves, then how else could it have been written? Should he have only presented one side (Mary's side? Or Don's side?) to the story?

195,"Source on this quote by Will McAvoy ""In the infancy of mass communications, the Columbus and Magellan of broadcast journalism, William Paley and David Sarnoff, went down to Washington to cut a deal with Congress. Congress would allow the fledgling networks free use of taxpayer-owned airwaves in exchange for one public service. That public service would be one hour of air time set aside every night for informational broadcasting, or what we now call the evening news.""

I've looked all over to get a source for this.

204,"How I felt about the ending The newsroom was a show that described what I would like an ideal media to be like: bold, unafraid, and always ready to call out bullshit when it needed to be done.



It wasn't just about that, though: I grew very attached to the characters. The drama, the romance, all of it. It was just so good to see how their lifes played out even out of the newsroom. That's the main reason I binge watched it... I hadn't watched a show like that in a long time.



It was awesome to see conservatives get called out on a lot of their non-sensical views, it was awesome to watch the never ending struggles happening all the time with all the characters: Jim-Maggie, Don-Sloan, Will-Mackenzie romances, Charlie and everyone always doing their best to just do a good show, that informed people instead of sacrificing actual important information for the sake of audience. 

Yes, it was a bit pretentious and almost arrogant sometimes, but that's what it needed to be and a lot of people in the real world do need to be called out on their opinions (because it often happens that their ""opinion"" goes against logic and even facts), and the show did an awesome job at that. There are a lot that would say the show took actual events with the benefit of hindsight (which I don't consider a bad thing), or that a great part of the show was just Aaron Sorkin being verysmart... I don't really agree.

That being said, I felt like the end was fitting: life goes on, those struggles will continue to be never ending and everyone will keep figthing the good fight. I wish Charlie hadn't died and thought it was downright shitty to have him agreeing to all the shit Ryan (don't remember the actual characters name, just thought of the name from the office) did, but he died fighting. The ending even gave the show a chance for revival, even though that's very unlikely to happen. Eventually they ran out of real news, and it would be shitty to make them up just so the show could go on.

208,"Found something that kinda fills the void I just started watching the shows from the last few months, and stumbled upon one that sounded similar in theme at least to the newsroom, so added it to my watching list. It's called Graves and it features a American President who was in the job a while before, strong conservative who has come to regret his decisions and policies. Starting wars, being homophobic, punishing illegals harder and stripping medical funding are some of the things he did that he has come to regret and is trying to make amends for.
Its nowhere like for like, Graves is much more political and less of a mission, no mission to civilize like Will had, just a old guy who wants to try and make amends and right the wrongs he caused. It is also a lot gaudier and low brow than the Newsroom. Though the fire is there and the passion that the Newsroom has. Its against a backdrop of a wife considering accepting a offer to run for a political office and the two kids having their own issues.

237,"One of my favorite quotes from Will McAvoy on what the Republican party has become. It's still as true today as it was when the episode aired (S2E09) &gt;I call myself a republican because I am one. I believe in market solutions. I believe in common sense realities, and the necessity to defend ourselves against a dangerous world, and that’s about it. Problem is, now I have to be homophobic. I have to count the number of times people go to church. I have to deny facts, and think scientific research is a long con. I have to think poor people are getting a sweet ride. And I have to have such a stunning inferiority complex that I fear education and intellect – in the 21st century. But most of all, the biggest new requirement, really the only requirement, is that I have to hate Democrats.

239,"Just finished the series. I enjoyed it but I had one problem... Will is most definitely a RINO (Republican In Name Only). It seemed like he called himself a Republican throughout the whole show, yet never once did I see him do or say anything that a Republican would. Even the left side of the Republican party greatly supported Romney, and the way Will attacked him incessantly was uncanny for someone claiming to be a Republican. It just gave a feeling of inauthenticity to the show, especially since Sorkin had written good Republican characters in the West Wing.

244,"Don's jacket S1E9 In episode 9 of the first season (Blackout II), Don is in three scenes.  In the first, he walks into Will's office to pick up the flowers delivered for him.  The second is the mock debate.  The third is in Lisa and Maggie's apartment at the end of the episode.  In all three scenes he is wearing a jacket or sweater.  The reason this is notable is because as Reese mentioned in Blackout I this is supposed to be the hottest this particular day in NYC has ever been.

In the first scene, Will even asks Don why he is wearing the jacket and Don responds that his own office is ""Ice station zebra.""  In the second scene all of the candidate representatives are wearing sweaters so no note is made.  In the third scene he walks into the room rubbing his hands together saying something about not being able to fix the AC so they are stuck with either ""90 degrees or 30.""  I guess the assumption is that it is currently 30 because of his thick jacket, but Maggie is wearing a very thin sweater and Lisa's outfit is sleeveless.

I'm probably nitpicking about a minor detail but it's bothering me.

264,"Is The Newsroom Sorkin's greatest work of television? I've just completed re-re-re-(etc)-watching the show and I had a thought. Sports Night was good. The West Wing was phenomenal. Studio 60 had real promise but was cut short. The Newsroom had time to grow and explore some interesting arcs. For me, The West Wing will always be the absolute pinnacle but I think due in equal measure to the cast and to the writing.

Considering only the seasons of WW that Sorkin wrote (up to S4 I think) which show would you say is the absolute best example of his televisual writing, and why?

IMO, The Newsroom wins handily. It had some great snappy banter that was in some ways missing in S60, which was for a long time my benchmark for good writing. It didn't ever rely on the tried-and-tested walk &amp; talk that by now is a trope. The stories were interesting and the behind-the-scenes look at reports on real life events made it more real, like it was a true fly-on-the-wall type show. The way you could see Will put his psyche back together over the course of the show. Genius.

I love WW, I love S60, but Newsroom is my new favourite Sorkin show.

I'm watching it via Kodi, and as I begun season 3, I accidentally hovered over the series finale, and I saw part of the first sentence of the episode synopsis, which is ""a sudden death leads Will and Mac to..."" that's as far as I got before realizing what I was doing.

I knew it would be Charlie. I was hoping I'd be wrong, and maybe, perhaps Maggie would be the one to die.

I was cheering on Sloane as she was ripping apart not-Neal about the Gawker Stalker thing he was in charge of.

Then down comes Charlie to tear holes in Mac and Sloane. That's when I realized Charlie only has seconds before he drops. I knew it was coming, and when it did happened, I still jumped and teared up. It was made worse by Charlie hitting his head on the way down. And then they had to rip off his bow tie.

And then they let us in on the fact that Will never had a cell mate at all, and he was just talking to his dead father.

And now he's free, and everything is fine! Except for the part that Charlie is dead!

Not that I think in the long run Will's source would've been mattered, but is still kind of intrigues me that it was mentioned but never really confirmed. The only thing I recall is Will saying, ""it's not POTUS, it's better than POTUS."" 

I remember in season one he had a text from Biden or something, which if I was in Will's position I would consider just as good as POTUS, But I couldn't imagine Biden feeding Will that much disinformation.

296,"Just finished my first watch. Spoilers all. The first season was one of the best put on television.  Will's opening scene is in the top five of any movie or T.V. show.  It really was Aaron Sorkin at some of his best.  Just about every scene had a reason to be there, whether it was to advance the plot or fill in back story.  Everything just clicked to make it a phenomenal season.

First half of season two was almost as good as season one.  I cant really put my finger on why I wasnt as excited as watching the first season.  I can say that the moment I audibly said ""this is where he lost it"" when Leona showed up high in ep 7.  It was great to see Jane Fonda act like that, but the whole thing seemed forced.  Knowing that the show was on a limited run, I felt that was the beginning of the end.  There were three distinct  moments I had to look away.  The show went from captivating to cringe inducing. (I'm sorry to use that word, but that the best way to describe it.) And goddamn, do I want to punch B.J. Novac in the face every time I see him.  So good at playing a douche.

Now we get the grand send off.  Six episodes for Sorkin to shine and give us all an amazing ending.  What do we get?  Another death only to create drama.  But it's ok because Will and Mac are having a baby.  And you want to use a good portion of your last 65 minutes for each main characters ACN origin story.  

I can see why there are only 25 episodes.  It had the possibility to run as long as West Wing did.  He just lost the thread 3/4ths of the way through the second season.  I think it would have lasted a lot longer if he didnt try to make it so complicated.  There will be recommendations it to anyone who hasnt seen it because the good parts are just so damn good.

I thought Bill Nye, The Science Guy, was also an actor who played Charlie Skinner in The Newsroom. And I guess I thought there was some continuation with the colorful bowties across his life and playing this character.

It just now occurred to me that these are two different people. Mind blown.

313,"Jim and Maggie A belated question regarding Jim and Maggie. The series seemingly ends with the two finally together. But during the flashbacks, we learned that Jim previously had a long-term relationship, which did not work out. And indeed, during the show, we see Jim attempt a long-term relationship, which doe not work out. Now Jim says that this time it'll work because he's truly in love, and I took that at face value when I watched the finale. Jim was in love with MacKenzie while overseas, after all, and he was in love with Maggie while back home.

But a thought occurred to me today -- is it possible that, in fact, we're just seeing Jim enter into another long-term relationship that will fail? We've seen Jim fail pretty consistently at maintaining relationships in the show. I know some have suggested that the main story of the show is the Jim and Maggie love story (it's what ties together the full series, from beginning to end), but is it possible that in fact, the show has foreshadowed a less than good end to this love story?

324,"The More I Watch Season 3 the More I Think Neil was Wrong and Kind of a Jerk and ACN was Wrong... I love watching and rewatching the Newsroom and I'm watching Season 3 now and as stated in the title, I really am having a problem sympathizing with and/or liking Neil as well as feeling that ACN was in the right morally.  

* First off.  I don't like how naive he is with the receiving of the data.  A guy like that should know what is right/wrong when it comes to this data.
* I don't like how he tries to be all tough with Will in Episode 2.  Wanting to go to jail is self indulgent and a way to get manufactured credibility.   
* I think that he and Will should absolutely have given up the source and making them seem like heroes.  Not to say what was done by the marketing company was acceptable, but the FBI was right in that the source could have spilled information that could put assets in the field in jeopardy.   
* Mac was the only one that acted admirably in that she threatened the source that she will reveal her if she doesn't give them the time to vet everything.  
* Will saying he ""couldn't give the source"" is just NOT a true statement.  He didn't want to.  Simple as that.  There was nothing meta-physically stopping him from doing so.  Him not verifying it after her death was him being a dick.  He could have easily done so ""via the side door"" as his lawyer put it to end it all.   He was totally wrong.  
* Neil was a SUPER DICK at the end when he told that one guy he was ashamed of him.  The guy just was doing his job that the new ownership wanted him to do.  He was embarrassed by Sloan on TV because she is friends with Erin Andrews.  He comes back from Venezuela after committing espionage and he is ashamed of him?   

Again, love the show but it's sometimes very hard being a fan of Sorkin with stuff like this.  He was like this in Studio 60 as well (very preachy about the Christian Right/Hannah) but was much more even handed on the West Wing.

Neil starts the show as a blog writer for Will, which is completely credible for a journalist that knows a thing or two about the web.

http://np.reddit.com/r/Thenewsroom/comments/2lu24j/if_i_love_the_newsroom_should_i_go_watch_the_west/
asking if I should watch the west wing.
Well, the responses were overwhelmingly in favor of me getting off my ass and watching the west wing immediately, which brings me to the first ""I hate you guys"" because my thoughts after a few episodes were along the lines of ""7 seasons, 22 episodes a season, what have I gotten myself into?!?""
Of course I fairly quickly became obsessed with the show, and am still amazed that I never discovered it when it was new to TV, leading me to ""I love you guys"" for introducing me to it.
But, sadly, last night I finally watched the last (three) episodes.  and now I hate everyone and everything for not having new West Wing episodes in my life anymore!  Woe is me! What do I do now?!

* a journalist writing a piece about the show - Martha O'Dell, Brain Brenner

391,"[Episode Discussion] I expected more out of S2E05: News Night with Will McAvoy (the whole post is spoilers I'm not going to bother with tags in the body) I've been watching the series the past two weeks and was excited, as soon as I saw the title, for what should have been the best episode of the series. It did what I expected but deviated with inane, unnecessary subplots. 

What it should have been was simply News Night and behind the scenes of the show. Have a breaking news drama (that actually entered the broadcast - how was that not done?). Have a subplot with Will's father's death. Have the bullshit twitter thing. Have the Genoa story arc expanded upon.

I was expecting a production-side/on-air broadcast plot only. It would have been great. 

Why did they fluff up the episode with the nudie pic sideplot? The lengthy timeline disparity is confusing as hell, especially with Maggie having her exact usual haircut after the end of the previous ep being her cutting it off and appearing at the examination. 

I appreciate the human drama, but to cut it out to simply show the news would have been interesting and in line with the theme of the show. This episode could have been special and different and standalone but they mucked it up.

402,"[Spoilers all] My Newsroom Retrospective, The Good, The Bad, and the Unfinished The Newsroom ended last night. Watched the finale and obviously I felt it during the closing lines of Sam Waterson's Charlie Skinner ""We did the news well because, we just decided to"" - A call back to the episode title of the Pilot episode. The short lived emotion I felt in that scene was shrouded by the cloud that the show never was what it could have been.

As a huge fan of Aaron Sorkin's ""The West Wing"" (and as a passive viewer of ""Studio 60"") I was beyond elated to hear the news of his new HBO show about a news network. The buzz came slowly but steady as we learned of the amazing casting for the show. The first promo spot featuring Jeff Daniels amazing rant about why we ""aren't the best country in the world - but we can be"" really struck home with me. In college I was a bit of a political activist, but like most people, the more you learn about the way the world works, the more you become disheartened by anyone with a voice or ability to change it.

I was looking forward to a smart show, would slap the face of partisanship and give me an intellectually stimulating drama to the same effect that ""The West Wing"" gave me, but even better. It's on HBO, shorter seasons (means less filler and fluff) the ability to use adult language and situations when necessary. I was ready with my eyes wide open.

This is not to say my ""expectations of a follow up to 'The West Wing'"" were too high. I was simply looking for what I felt was being advertised, which is less than the show ended up being.

Within the first season the show was trying extremely hard to ""out quirk"" itself. With the show belittling itself to a campy cute romantic comedy at times. I'm no one to shy away from love stories in shows by any means, but the show diluted itself with multiple love stories before really giving us one to truly care about. It became clear it was Will-Mack and Jim-Maggie but it really felt forced on us before it even got into the character development. The show did the equivalent of what ""News Night"" was so adamantly against. They were trying to please a larger audience instead of telling the story they wanted to tell. It came out as a show that I wasn't sure if I was supposed to really believe these love stories or if the show was trying to make social commentary about the media's role in the sociopolitical landscape with the protagonists actively trying to inform their viewers of issues that effect them in a bipartisan way and the antagonists were dumbing it down for ratings and harming civil discourse because of it.

Within 2 or 3 episodes, I simply felt we were being dumbed down the way Reese Lansing would have and that Sorkin was capable of so much better than this. The Gabby Giffords episode ""I'll Try To Fix You"" ended with an amazing emotional climax and music montage, perhaps a cheap effect albiet, but it was SMART. ""Doctor pronounces people dead, not the news"" I was hopeful once again. I still will sometimes look back to the ending of that episode to remember how good it was.

It picked up in it's second season but not enough, ultimately the show was cancelled and Aaron Sorkin seemed to admit he dropped the ball on the entire series. A series finale for a show with just 25 episodes (just 3 more than the first season of 'The West Wing', and that show had 7 seasons) was strangely unemotional for me, but it the end I still *felt it* and that what I wanted the show to do. I did a few times, but simply not enough.

With a show I watch until the end I usually have two reactions, ""Oh I wish it didn't end so soon but what a ride"" or ""It was time for the show to end"" (With the latter usually being the case unfortunately) but my reaction to this show was incredibly unique, because while I understand why it ended so soon, I really wished it could have had the chance to be the show I wanted it to be, which it so carefully toyed with so many times. I imagine the emotional apex of Charlie's death and Mack taking over as President being so impactful after 5-6 seasons, but that's not how the cards fell and I have to deal with that.

The show had such an amazing ensemble cast, perhaps one of the most intellectual show runners ever, a great writing staff, a great network, it seemed to have everything, but for some reason it just never got it's chance to come together. The biggest shame is that we won't ever get a chance to see that cast again together.

413,"Why hating the finale might be what the writers wanted. (Spoilers)     So my friend and I got together to watch the final episode. He bought a cheap bottle of Jameson Whiskey to toast to Charley and the end of one of our favorite shows. (Yes, we are total nerds) 
   Within 15 minutes we HATED it. I felt that several flashbacks manipulated characters in a way the fit only the narrative of the finale. The most blatant was the idea that Don was always a true believer in portraying only the news. (I watched season 1 last week, mostly because I have too much time on my hands after finals) First season Don felt so much different from Finale flashback Don. I also hated the whole notion that Charley secretly wanted the staff of the newsroom to fight with him. (making it seem his heart burst from  joy) I felt that Charley was genuinely flighting to keep the staff from being fired. It seemed that Sloan and company had utterly broken the peace Charley had brokered. The flashbacks told how Charley was the puppet master behind the changes to Will's show, what I wondered was who didn't know that. I felt that the flashbacks beat us over the head on this idea.  The guitar scene was… well… Like I said before, my friend and I hated the episode.
     So after a couple of shots, our swearing began to give way to discussion. I brought up that hating the episode might be what the writers actually wanted. I just finish taking 2 semesters of Theatre History. Last semester we studied ""Three Penny Opera."" (stick with me) The play is about a rogue that keeps dodging punishment by the law and the thieves guild. (rough summary) In the end he is about to be hung, and then out of nowhere the queen comes and saves him, duex machina style. The ending is abrupt and offers little explanation. Most consider it an unsatisfactory ending to good play. The ending is so abrupt that it takes the audience out of the illusion of the play. It allows the audience to think about what they just saw rather than just continuing to watch mindlessly. 

So, do you think there is any chance that this explain why the Newsroom ending seems so unfulfilling? 

Other arguments that we came up with were: This was Sorkin's tribute to himself. The writers couldn't figure out to end it, so they went with the Wayne's World happy ending. Sorkin gave up. HBO said no to a darker ending.

We also realized that we would probably not be happy with any ending.

444,"Another topic Sorkin touches on this season. One thing I picked up on this season is that Sorkin touches on the idea that young people will ignore the advice from the older generation and try things out themselves, without thinking of all the consequences for those involved. Whether this is strictly a Millennial thing or not, I have no idea.

We see it with Randy/Blaire where they want to strike out on their own. They don't care if 100k people lose their jobs, they want to have the experience of doing it on their own and getting in touch with their entrepreneurial side.

So I was thinking about what the title represents. The song is, of course, beautiful. 

This is what I found online.

""Shenandoah"" (also called ""Oh Shenandoah"", or ""Across the Wide Missouri"") is an American folk song, dating to the early 19th century. The lyrics may tell the story of a roving trader in love with the daughter of an Indian chief; in this interpretation, the rover tells the chief of his intent to take the girl with him far to the west, across the Missouri River. Other interpretations tell of a pioneer's nostalgia for the Shenandoah River Valley in Virginia, and a young woman who is its daughter; or of a Union soldier in the American Civil War, dreaming of his country home to the west of the Missouri river, in Shenandoah, Iowa (though the town lies some 50 miles east of the river).

sorry went on a tangent, but yeah, if only they could do a follow up movie (firefly did), i'd definitely think the center news story could revolve around what's happening in the US today with all the cops killing African Americans and getting off.  they're getting wrecked in public (not saying they shouldn't here, or that they should, just reality), and in a situation not involving any of these cases, if a white cop were in the right, they would have no shot publicly, just like the af-ams getting shot have no shot in the justice system right now.  AS did do a similar storyline in West Wing about a white cop and a black kid, and that was very deep.  but it was all towards a political situation and the type of convo they just had about rape.  (I do have to say, AS isn't shying away from any topic)  WW does address race a ton, multiple charlie storylines, reparations, the cop, the comedian, some of the appointed officials, etc etc.  but all political.

465,"So let's talk about the scene everyone seems to hate [Episode Discussion] I want to discuss the ""rape"" scene as everyone seems to be calling it. 

I want to honestly know what other people who watch this show think of the scene and what they took away from it. 

I want, for the record, to state that I am a male journalist. I work for a medium sized print publication with a similar style of staff to the news room. I'd most liken myself to Don, in that it's my job to meet with people and get their story. Find out things about them.

I think there are three things that need to be discussed. 
1. Was what Don saying bad/wrong/evil? 
2. Was what Mary doing the ethically right thing to do?
3. What was the point Sorkin was trying to make?



I'll go first to get things rolling.

**Was what Don saying bad/wrong/evil?**

I think Don was playing the ""Justice System"" card, which is ultimately Sorkin's message. (I'll get to this later.) I don't think Don is wrong in what he said but he doesn't offer what I think to be a good solution. I believe he's not saying she's lying, (when she accused him of it I immediately and audibly was like no...that's not what he's saying), I believe he's saying that because of the way the law works, without further evidence, it's her word against his and we know how that all plays out. So I don't think he's a ""rape apologist"" or whatever the critics are saying.

**Is what Mary is doing the ethically right thing to do?**

Ethics are different for everyone and I hope we all think about the website and how it will effect people. 

I draw a similar correlation to the herpes alert website, because like herpes, if you're raped that's something I feel stays with a person forever. 
We all know that there are a ton of people on there who have herpes and aren't telling their partners. We also know there is a percentage of people on there that are 100% herpes free and someone wanted to harm them in that manner for that reason.

So the ethical question for us all is this: Is the damage caused to rapists worth the damage to non rapists? 

I think a lot of people will say that for every false report of rape there are 1000000000000 rapes that are not prosecuted (I'm exaggerating because I don't know the figures but I know it's a high ratio) and there are 10000000000000000 more rapes that aren't reported. 

But that's not the idea. We all agree that any amount of rape is a bad thing and any rapist should be punished. But are we willing to overlook that there will be collateral damage and those people will never get justice either? Aren't we just creating more victims that won't have justice over people that harmed them?

To me there has to be a better way. I don't know what it is, but there has to be it. The anonymous way it hypothetically would be reported to me seems a little backwords. Maybe I'm wrong but in court if you accuse someone of rape, they have the right to know who it was. Shouldn't the same apply to the accused of rape? 

**What was the point that Sorkin was trying to make?**
I think there are three reasons this story was put in. One, they needed to actually look like they're working. Two, Don needed a reason to fight against the owner. Three, Sorkin is questioning how our justice system works. 

Our law works (or doesn't depending on your point of view) by operating under the idea that everyone is innocent until a jury of your peers believes you are guilty beyond reasonable doubt. 

I personally believe ""slut shaming"" --saying the victim was wearing something, doing something or ""indicating something"" that meant the victim wanted to have sex should not be allowed as evidence. The victim either said yes or she said no. The victim was either capable of making that decision or not. When we are very clear about what we, as a society to be rape, then I think the law can be better enforced. 

Anyway, what is everyone else's thoughts on the episode and the following discussion. 

I'm curious to see what everyone says. (I also apologize for grammar mistakes and if this discussion is to much about rape and not enough about the newsroom if so Mods feel free to delete.)

think don wa playing the justice system card which is ultimately sorkin s message i ll get to this later i don t think don is wrong in what he said but he doesn t offer what i think to be a good solution i believe he s not saying she s lying when she accused him of it i immediately and audibly wa like no that s not what he s saying i believe he s saying that because of the way the law work without further evidence it s her word against his and we know how that all play out so i don t think he s a rape apologist or whatever the critic are saying is what mary is doing the ethically right thing to do ethic are different for everyone and i hope we all think about the website and how it will effect people i draw a similar correlation to the herpes alert website because like herpes if you re raped that s something i feel stay with a person forever we all know that there are a ton of people on there who have herpes and aren t telling their partner we also know there is a percentage of people on there that are 100 herpes free and someone wanted to harm them in that manner for that reason so the ethical question for u all is this is the damage caused to rapist worth the damage to non rapist i think a lot of people will say that for every false report of rape there are 1000000000000 rape that are not prosecuted i m exaggerating because i don t know the figure but i know it s a high ratio and there are 10000000000000000 more rape that aren t reported but that s not the idea we all agree that any amount of rape is a bad thing and any rapist should be punished but are we willing to overlook that there will be collateral damage and those people will never get justice either aren t we just creating more victim that won t have justice over people that harmed them to me there ha to be a better way i don t know what it is but there ha to be it the anonymous way it hypothetically would be reported to me seems a little backwords maybe i m wrong but in court if you accuse someone of rape they have the right to know who it wa shouldn t the same apply to the accused of rape what wa the point that sorkin wa trying to make i think there are three reason this story wa put in one they needed to actually look like they re working two don needed a reason to fight against the owner three sorkin is questioning how our justice system work our law work or doesn t depending on your point of view by operating under the idea that everyone is innocent until a jury of your peer belief you are guilty beyond reasonable doubt i personally believe slut shaming saying the victim wa wearing something doing something or indicating something that meant the victim wanted to have sex should not be allowed a evidence the victim either said yes or she said no the victim wa either capable of making that decision or not when we are very clear about what we a a society to be rape then i think the law can be better enforced anyway what is everyone else s thought on the episode and the following discussion i m curious to see what everyone say i also apologize for grammar mistake and if this discussion is to much about rape and not enough about the newsroom if so mod feel free to delete edit formatting, so let s talk about the scene everyon seem to hate episod discuss i want to discuss the rape scene as everyon seem to be call it i want to honestli know what other peopl who watch thi show think of the scene and what they took away from it i want for the record to state that i am a male journalist i work for a medium size print public with a similar style of staff to the news room i d most liken myself to don in that it s my job to meet with peopl and get their stori find out thing about them i think there are three thing that need to be discuss 1 wa what don say bad wrong evil 2 wa what mari do the ethic right thing to do 3 what wa the point sorkin wa tri to make i ll go first to get thing roll wa what don say bad wrong evil i think don wa play the justic system card which is ultim sorkin s messag i ll get to thi later i don t think don is wrong in what he said but he doesn t offer what i think to be a good solut i believ he s not say she s lie when she accus him of it i immedi and audibl wa like no that s not what he s say i believ he s say that becaus of the way the law work without further evid it s her word against hi and we know how that all play out so i don t think he s a rape apologist or whatev the critic are say is what mari is do the ethic right thing to do ethic are differ for everyon and i hope we all think about the websit and how it will effect peopl i draw a similar correl to the herp alert websit becaus like herp if you re rape that s someth i feel stay with a person forev we all know that there are a ton of peopl on there who have herp and aren t tell their partner we also know there is a percentag of peopl on there that are 100 herp free and someon want to harm them in that manner for that reason so the ethic question for us all is thi is the damag caus to rapist worth the damag to non rapist i think a lot of peopl will say that for everi fals report of rape there are 1000000000000 rape that are not prosecut i m exagger becaus i don t know the figur but i know it s a high ratio and there are 10000000000000000 more rape that aren t report but that s not the idea we all agre that ani amount of rape is a bad thing and ani rapist should be punish but are we will to overlook that there will be collater damag and those peopl will never get justic either aren t we just creat more victim that won t have justic over peopl that harm them to me there ha to be a better way i don t know what it is but there ha to be it the anonym way it hypothet would be report to me seem a littl backword mayb i m wrong but in court if you accus someon of rape they have the right to know who it wa shouldn t the same appli to the accus of rape what wa the point that sorkin wa tri to make i think there are three reason thi stori wa put in one they need to actual look like they re work two don need a reason to fight against the owner three sorkin is question how our justic system work our law work or doesn t depend on your point of view by oper under the idea that everyon is innoc until a juri of your peer believ you are guilti beyond reason doubt i person believ slut shame say the victim wa wear someth do someth or indic someth that meant the victim want to have sex should not be allow as evid the victim either said ye or she said no the victim wa either capabl of make that decis or not when we are veri clear about what we as a societi to be rape then i think the law can be better enforc anyway what is everyon els s thought on the episod and the follow discuss i m curiou to see what everyon say i also apolog for

478,"What Sorkin (and his characters) don't understand about ""young people"" and their relationship with the media. *""Young people know when they're being talked down to""*.  This isn't the first show I've seen this sentiment expressed on, but Sorkin's take is especially hilarious in his obtuseness because the entire foundation of The Newsroom's hero's is on faulty ground.  The show and it's characters are fighting for a dying institution/medium.  It's over. The genie can't go back into the bottle. The internet, and the ""new media"" will only grow, and it's up to the old media to figure out how to adapt, or die.

Instead of condescending to the new generation about sensationalized headlines and bite-sized tidbits, versus in-depth coverage and contrasting opinions, it might be worthwhile to actually examine what is it about the digital world today that leads to these new information consumption patterns.

Despite all romanticism to the contrary, the ""old-school"" journalism that Sorkin portrays is not without faults. Fundamentally, it is a question of depth vs breadth. The world used to move a lot slower, and access to information was a lot harder, so depth was a natural approach. News stories and scandals would dominate the conscious and subconscious debate for longer periods of time. The cost of this was missing out and ignoring deeper scandals and letting them go on behind the scenes.  Numerous big stories (The Gulf of Tonklin, the british parliamentary pedophile ring, etc) were able to stay hidden throughout history because the average citizen did not have access to a distribution network with the power of the internet. 

In today's faster moving world, the new generation demands access to more information. More voices. More stories. More breadth. It's not a short attention span issue, it's a desire to not to have the veil pulled over our eyes like the old media loves to do, and always has done.  Reporting on ""tweets"" from ""citizen journalists"" during hour 4 of a 6 hour coverage of Casey Anthony is certainly not the answer, and The Newsroom is right to criticize it, but it's just a desperate attempt from the old media to stay relevant, it's not the next evolution.  The internet, the daily beast, slate, and hell, even buzzfeed with its long form journalism, and other sites just like it is what the future looks like. In 20 years, no one outside of a senior's home is going to be sitting down to watch news on the TV during a regularly scheduled hour.  I'm not saying THIS approach isn't without flaws either, but it's inevitable, and everyone needs to figure out how to work within it, rather than pining for the good ol' days.

The show tries desperately to villify visionaries who see the writing on the wall - to present them as immature kooky billionaires full of buzzwords and no valuable ideas.  But that's simply not how things work in the real world. And before you mention The New Republic to me, there are more examples that contradict their example than those that support it.  Whether it's Jeff Bezos buying the Washington Post, or the The New York Times successfully evolving into the 21st century, we know it can be done.

So yes, young people know when they're being talked down to. They know when they are being talked down to by an aging institution (Television drama) fighting for an aging institution (Television news), and it's probably why this show is only getting 6 episodes, and why the entire internet hate-watches this show, and shakes it's head for how out of touch Sorkin has gotten.",0, what sorkin and his character don t understand about young people and their

479,"What if...??? As of right now, Aaron Sorkin's only upcoming project is his Untitled Steve Jobs project. So, what if after that comes out in 2016, Aaron Sorkin (who will, as of right now, not be doing anything else at the time) decides he wants to do something of a miniseries of The Newsroom. He writes 4 episodes worth of material, &amp; it airs in June 2017. 

Now, this could be done in 1 of 2 ways.

- Do what Olive Kitteridge did &amp; air the 1st 2 episodes back-to-back on Sunday June 4th, &amp; the 3rd &amp; 4th episodes air on Monday the 5th.

- Air it over 4 Sundays (most likely from June 4-25)

Plus, HBO would probably jump at the chance b/c if I'm not mistaken, Olivia Munn said they were still under contract b/c HBO thought Sorkin might change his mind.

I'm sure most of the cast would love to come back [Spoiler](/s ""without Sam Waterston for obvious reasons"").

494,"[S03E05] How would the mob justice swing in the rape case? Since Sorkin got absolutely bombarded for the episode cause of the rape and letting Don make the call to ""not find her"" in the media (av club, vox ..)

How would you think that TV segment on ACN would play out. How would the mob react?

Facts:

- the show makes it abundantly clear that the rape happened, the viewers are never asked to question that
- she admitted to drinking too much tequila and using every drug which was placed in front of her: molly, coke, shrooms
- not the police, nor the DA, nor the campus police (with preponderance of evidence) wanted to touch the case
- she puked and passed out
- she has no visible (for the viewer) bruises anywhere and doesn't mention a struggle 
- they took off her cloths so it is to be assumed that she wasn't in control of her body
- the rapists are rich
- the rapists stick to a different story, but come across as sleazy 

---

The interview on TV:

She will repeat her story. If she doesn't bring up the insane amount of drugs the other party or the interviewer will. Also her website will come up.

The rapists will be coached by media professionals (they have rich parents and money) so they will likely come across better than when they talked to Don. They are rapists, so they are morally bankrupt and will lie. Based on that their story will be something like that:

We found her in the bathroom. She looked fine to us, but since she puked we offered to bring her into a bedroom to rest for a bit. While walking there we asked her why she puked and she told us that she just had one drink and doesn't know. She was very lively and showed us she is sober by pretending we were officers trying to arrest her. She walked a straight line and touched her nose with her fingers - you know the usual. She was outgoing and fun, we had no idea that she was full of drugs. In the room she not only gave enthusiastic consent, she literally begged us to fuck her and bring more people in. She said she never had a threesome before and wanted to cross that off her college list.

505,"Finale Theory: The kid(s) at the end of Camelot. It really feels to me like Mac &amp; Charlie's vision for ACN dies with Charlie and the final episode sees the gang split up and go out into the world. As ACN has crumbled we've seen Maggie become more confident, capable and assertive throughout this season. She weathered the storm last season and is now on the level of Don, Jim and Sloan. In fact we've seen them all do morally courageous things this season.

With that in mind, I offer the theory that the junior staff are ALL the ""kid at the end of Camelot"" Will references at the end of season one. 

Wherever they go to out into the world once ACN rebrands or self-destructs during the course of the finale, they carry on the institutions ACN instilled in them, ultimately influencing future generations on how to do the news based on the teachings of Charlie, Will and Mac. Because they have lived through and been there for ""News Night 2.0"" and the mock debate and everything else, they are the ones most qualified to ""tell people that it's possible."" 

The legacy of Charlie and even Will and Mac ultimately lives on in Maggie, Jim, Don, Sloan and everyone else. As Will rides off into the sunset he can reflect on a job well done that there was not just one ""kid at the end of Camelot"" but a whole staff full of them.

511,"Season Finale Hopeful Prediction (Spoilers and all that jazz) Inspired by Mac screaming at Reese ""Can't we ever win just one?!""

Will does a final broadcast dedicated to Charlie. 

Sloan and Don bring him up to speed on everything that has transpired in the days he's been away. He meets with the Lansings at the funeral who agree to assist him (Either with inside info for the cause or using the time to find a way to distract Pruit whilst Newsnight run the final broadcast). In the same vein that he apologised for the way ACN had been going up until Mac got there, he addresses the new direction Newsnight has taken under new ownership, calls out the negligence of citizen journalism, public invasion, biased speculations from those unqualified etc etc. Full broadcast in a blaze of glory that gets them all fired, like Jesus in the temple with the merchants. I don't think they're ever going to 'Win One' until they're willing to give up everything, which they weren't willing to do with Genoa and giving up the Source. The new ACN is not what Leona and Charlie built, it's not what the news team built and I think it's safe to assume that the staff are dedicated to Will enough to go down with the ship if he called it quits. 

Bonus would be if another Newscorp would take on their show at the very end, but I think it would end with them turning the lights off and leave us to imagine their fates.

513,"Sorkin's obsession with what college people went to Another episode that brings up where people went to school.  I just don't get it.  And frankly, it feels elitist to a level that's not even accurate.  I went to a very old, very good school myself and I can tell you I don't bring it up all the time nor hang it over people's head.  And neither do the people I went to that school with.  I have no idea why he thinks the school people went to is so important to professionals when its half a lifetime ago.  The working world quickly teaches you to flush any collegiate pomp down the toilette and gain some real world skills and experience.  So nothing is more useless and shitty than someone who hangs their hat on what college they went to, especially if they are middle-aged.

And furthermore Sorkin continues to give this uber alles revelry to ivy league/British colleges.  You can get a comparable education at any number of state colleges like UC Berkeley, UVA, Michigan, the military academies; and their admission process doesn't factor in a bunch of legacy/donor under-the-table bullshit.  But still, in his shows someone has to go to a top university by old money standards and as soon as someone namedrops, the discussion goes cold as the other party submits in some ridiculous subordination to a name.

To put in perspective his over-emphasis on educational accolades over substance or reality, I began reading up on the big time anchors of today to see if they had such achievements.  Brian Williams didn't even finish college.  George Stephanopolous has a similar background to Will McAvoy but actually got his masters in theology as opposed to cliche law degree.  David Muir - bachelors degree from Ithaca College.  Scott Pelley - Texas Tech.  Wolf Blizter - University of Buffalo followed by Johns Hopkins.  So you get the picture.  Not only its Sorkin's obsession with the ivy league and where people went to school weird, its certainly not representative of where the upper echelon in the journalism field attended.  And I certainly didn't know where any of these anchors went to school nor does it now at all temper my opinion on their efficacy.

522,"A quick interpretation of tonight's big events [SPOILERS AHEAD] You've been warned.

So Charlie died. As devastating as it was, it's probably the most symbolic way he could have died. 

Charlie represents old school reporting from the days of Woodward and Bernstein, where immediacy wasn't quite superiority (being fast helped, but getting it right was the focus.) Then Pruett shows up. He's a millennial kid who thinks citizen journalism, reporting on celebrities and essentially cutting out fact-checking and other hallmarks of journalism will save it. 

When Charlie spends the entire episode telling his reporters to go along with it, he's taking on the role of the journalism industry. The changes he endured were such a shock that it ended his life, and Sorkin thinks current new journalism trends will kill off the industry that stands for reporting on the most important stories instead of celebrity bullshit.

I'm really sad to see him go and this episode's events certainly paint him as a tragic figure. But I'm struggling to find a better way to kill him off. It's one of the hits in this episode filled with either really strong writing (Don and the rape victim) and poorly-written work (Jim and Maggie.)

523,"[Spoiler] A word about Aaron Sorkin Ok, let me start off by saying that Aaron Sorkin is my favourite writer for both TV and Film. In my opinion, the greatest words in the english language are ""Written By Aaron Sorkin"". However... He does have an air of predictability when it comes to certain things, the main one being evidenced in last nights episode.

If I where an actor being cast in an Aaron Sorkin series over the age of 50 and a friend/confidante to the main character, I wouldn't bother unpacking! So far, I cannot think of a single series where an older and usually wiser character hasn't at the very least had a life threatening medical problem, and at the worst, died!

In Sports Night, possibly the only excusable example of the bunch, they gave Isaac Jaffe a stroke that caused him to be absent for the second half of the first series and a distinct change in his outlook on life in the second season. I say this is excusable, as the only reason this was necessary was the actor who played him, the ever-talented Robert Guillaume, had a severe stroke midway through filming...

Next, we come to loveable Leo McGarry, President Bartlett's CoS and his best friend. Not only did working give this guy a heart attack and fire him, he then killed him off! Again, the death was only a part of the season due to John Spencers death in real life, but surely for a writer with the talents of Sorkin there could have been a work around that didn't involve me still sobbing uncontrollably when I watch this episode even to this day. (21 year old Male by the way).

And as if killing off the chief of staff wasn't enough, he had already taken the pen and ink to kill off my favourite minor character Sorkin has ever constructed, Mrs Landingham! I know that it was necessary motivation for the MS thing as well as running for office, but at the time I remember it just seeming senseless.

Then we come to the most throwaway health issue out of the four of them, firing Wes Mendel on day one of the series, and then six months later giving him a heart attack 6 years ago! We never particularly got to see his character in play, although it was quite clear that he was an important part of the lives of all of the main characters!

And finally, last night. Charlie Skinner was one of my favourite characters Sorkin had ever written. Funny, dry wit, old establishment with a compassion and lovability that shone through in some of the best character development I have ever seen in a series. And to see him almost make it to the final episode and die 60 minutes away from a happy life of being written and theorised about in the inevitable outpouring of ""what would they be doing now"" fan fiction is just heartbreaking. In some ways, sorkin is almost as impactful as a tragedy writer as he is a drama writer.

I'm going with his name (given to him by Neal, for purposes unknown) is fake. He realized this just before going into the grand jury.

He knows that Mackenzie knows the source personally, so now the only way he can expose the source is by pointing them to Mac. So he married her. Now, he (potentially, by the rules of TV) can't be compelled to incriminate her.

My first instinct was to look on IMDB at the future episodes to see if I could spot any names. Huge mistake, because I came across this link.  

[This link contains indirect spoilers.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3680822/?ref_=tt_ep_nx)

So, on that page you can see there are mourners as names of some of the actors.  Well shit, someone is going to die in the last episode or episode before.

Then I see something that leads me to believe, the person I don't want to die, is going to die. The character the actress Audrey Rose is playing is ""Charlie's Daughter.""  

In the last episode, Charlie mentioned he spoke to his daughter.  This is the only thing that makes me hope, it could be Charlie's ex-wife that dies, but I personally believe it will be Charlie.

Any other evidence for it being Charlie who dies? Well I searched on google before I finally determined it was Charlie that would die and found this.

[Last Episode Synopsis](http://www.hypable.com/2014/11/19/the-newsroom-series-finale-synopsis-the-question-is-who/)

They mention the synopsis and it states that a death will effect Will and Mac.  It also mentions Neal, Leona, Pruit and Maggie are doing something, so they probably won't die.  They put up Charlie as their first guess too and while I don't agree that he will the one of the least heartbreaking, I agree with their prediction.

580,"How The Newsroom Ends (Spoiler Alert!) Jim and Hallie sit in silence in a booth at Hang Chew's. On a television above them, Sloan's show is on, and she is reporting that someone has bought Continental Corp for some ridiculous sum. At the same time, a stock graph for NYSE: SIA appears showing a marked increase in share price. Jim admits he was a dick and apologizes to Hallie, but then starts to recant when he gets a push notification from his phone w/ her article -- a takedown piece on the still-a-fugitive Neal and the leaked government documents. It gets 1.6 millions page views. Hallie tells Jim thanks for everything, but she's got her prize piece and a book deal now. After taking a moment to reassure Jim that he was adequate in bed, Hallie get up and walks off. 

Jim slumps in his seat, devastated, as a mysterious stranger sitting in the booth behind him turns to him and says ""Your friend is going to be fine."" Jim asks how the stranger knows, to which he replies ""I just know. I always just know"", and gets up to leave. A beat later, and another push notification on Jim's phone. ACN reports that the source has come clean and has taken full responsibility. Jim turns around looking puzzled -- who was that mysterious man?

Cut to AWM boardroom. Just as Lucas Pruit's bid for AWM is about to go through, Calvin Trager walks into the board room to announce that Quo Vadimus has just completed a hostile takeover of Savannah Capital and is buying AWM after all, paying off the Lansing Twins for a full $1/share over what Pruitt offered. He gruffly announces that ""Anyone who can't make money off of News Night should get out of the money making business."" and then pointedly stares at the camera for about 10 seconds in silence. Blair looks bitchy and hot and says something about not caring as long as she gets hers before passionately kissing Pruit. Leona and Charlie are so elated that they initiate crazy old drunk sex on the boardroom carpet (off-camera) while Will and Mackenzie have a staring contest that may never end. Don rushes in, tripping over the old fornicators with Sloan walking right in behind him. They say that they don't care what happens to their jobs, but they need to get married right away. Randy happens to be an ordained minister (from the Internet, but who cares) and notary, so Sloan and Don have a quickie wedding followed by a high five and also begin rolling around the boardroom floor in orgiastic glee. Jim and Maggie walk into the room and look at each other, shrug their shoulders in resignation and drop to the floor as well. Rebecca Halliday just stands over all of them observing the scene, looking smoky. Newly-exonerated Neal walks into the room, tripping over Don and Sloan, and cluelessly says ""What did I miss?"" Everyone immediately stops to hug him. Will, Jim, and Don decide to carry Neal into the Newsroom, Rudy-style. 

We follow our gang through the newsroom, where everyone stands and cheers. Red news alerts are going off like crazy and Eliot is on the air trying to give a report about Mohammed Morsi, but no one gives a shit. Charlie throws Gary Cooper a key and tells him to open the bottom drawer on the right side of his desk. Gary says ""I thought that thing was broken"" when he unlocks it and finds rolls of old ticker tape.  Charlie yells from across the room ""I've been saving it for a special occasion!"" and suddenly ticker tape is flying around the newsroom. Intern Jenna drops a tray of coffee. 

Trager walks into an elevator and observes the pandemonium with a calm look on his face as the doors close. 

Trager stands on the roof of the AWM building, looking out for the Bus, which lands just in time. The hatch opens and we see a cane, followed by feet. Nick Fury walks out onto the roof and looks around, announcing ""mmm mmm! I just love it when white people have a happy ending!"" Staring out into the New York skyline, we see the nearly-finished Freedom Tower where the CSC letters are being replaced by a logo for Stark International.

I think its lacking in character diversity. I think the story is sometimes just silly with the amount and magnitude of mistakes made. I think the romance story lines are questionable. But overall its clearly a quality show with amazing dialogue, and is an entertaining, intellectually stimulating watch. There's some excellent and topical political commentary as well.

But I came on reddit to see what people thought and the criticism has been atrocious. Ive seen complaints that the dialogue is not realistic. Really? The dialogue on a television show being ""unrealistic"" is a legitimate criticism? Ive seen people complain that the female characters are poorly constructed and stupid. Aside from Maggie, I have liked the female characters on the show more than almost any other show. They aren't shown as being beneath men, or less intelligent than men in any way. I feel like there is real equality in terms of the importance, intellect, and input of the female characters. 

Does the show get soap boxy? Well yeah, and that's a legitimate complaint, but I didn't find it nearly as pretentious as the majority of people seem to.

Do you guys think the hate the show gets is justified? Am I glossing over some of the real problems of the show with rose-tinted lenses?

This has never happened in the U.S. before, so it will be major news, it will dominate not just the news, but also political discussions.

This will cause ACN’s ratings to go through the roof.

Consequently, ACN stock will also skyrocket. In fact, the stock price will get so high, that the investment firm that was going to buy the shares from the twins, backs out. They say that the shares are just too expensive, and it’s not worth the cost.

629,"[Spoilers] Neal's legal situation post Boston Season 3 Episode 1 regarding Neals legal problem...

Neal is being set up.
Season 2 Episode 5, Charlie has a meeting with his 'source'.
Charlie calls him 'Shep' in their meeting, and we learn that he is a 'spy' that works for ONI, the Office of Naval Intelligence.
Shep gives charlie the document that we come to know as the helicopter manifest in the Genoa story, which supposedly has reference to the sarin gas, but is really a secret personal note to Charlie that says ""fuck you"".

In the conclusion of the Genoa story, Red team III, Charlie goes to meet Shep in a parking garage. Shep reveals that he set Charlie up with the manifest because he blames Charlie for the death of his son. The only other person Shep mentions by name in that conversation is Neal. He blames Neal and Charlie equally for his sons suicide because Neal fired David (Shep's son). He also states he is confused by the medias fascination with the number 3, ""3 days 3 months 3 years""

The email message Neal gets tells him to up his encryption to be able to handle 3 trillion (tri=3) guesses per second. He receives about 27,000 documents (30x30x30, or 30^3=27,000). 27000 divided by 90 days (the total number of days David worked for ACN)=300 documents a day. (lots of 3's)

It would make sense that the situation Neal finds himself in now, with the stolen documents, has been set up by Shep to lure him into doing something illegal, which he can then be arrested for. It's entrapment if the Newsroom can prove it, but right now it looks like they haven't figured out what is going on. 

BTW the USB key that Neal gets was hidden in a toilet in a steak house in NYC. This is obviously a Godfather reference. Michael Corleone gets a gun from a toilet and then is forced into hiding in Italy for several years after the killing. Neal enters the bathroom, and there is a man at the sink. When the man looks over at Neal he smiles, then looks down, wipes his hands, and leaves the bathroom.
The man in the bathroom is the one who left the USB key.

The Newsroom need to realize, and then find a way to prove that Shep leaked the documents. 
They really have no choice but to do it on their own. They could go to the FBI, but there is a risk that ONI has people there too. Although they may cooperate with some federal agency to smoke out the leek. Im not sure which direction they will go.
So Neals current storyline is sort of a continuation of the Genoa storyline.

If the team can root out Shep as the leak, they could then go public with the fact that they were set up on Genoa from the beginning over a personal grievance. This would restore their credibility, and renew their reputation with the government sources they currently have but are unable to use because of Genoa.

At the end of season 3 episode 1, Neal describes the secret documents he received. He says BCD is a contractor for SOCOM that places stories in foreign press about US soldiers doing community outreach in addition propaganda to help our foreign policy. This happens to be exactly what Maggie ended up doing in Africa, though she never completes that story as far as we know.

So it is also possible that Shep is the one that OK's Maggie's trip to Africa, knowing she was being sent in to a dangerous area, maybe even intentionally trying to get her and Gary killed, though I am not sure why at this point, other than to continue to fuck with Charlie.

631,"[Spoiler](/s ""Damnit, I think I understand ""The Newsroom"", the way Sorkin wanted to portray it. Read if you want spoilers"") I think The Newsroom was supposed to be about a character exploration of Will McAvoy and we took it to be an idealistic statement about the way a Newsroom ought to be run. 

Think about it, the whole series thus far we've been getting crippling insights about Will McAvoys character, and his innermost frailty and the best we got from everyone else is a supporting evidence or comedic relief. 

I think Sorkin wanted to explore a frail old-middle aged man who is Highly Intelligent and has the ego of someone who is Highly Intelligent (Intellectual pissing contests are a constant) takes up the beliefs of those around him just to be liked by them. And when he inevitably gets bit in the ass he is unable to take it, because he never believed truly in them, and he takes it as an attack on his character, and not his ideas. 


* Why he couldn't handle it when Mac Cheated on him.
* He's a Republican because he's a Nebraskan. And not because he espouses the ideas of the Party in it's current state.
* He takes it personally to oversee the well being of his staff even though he has no obligation to --&gt; circling back to protecting his siblings from his drunk dad (the therapist laid this out for us)
* He's in a Newsroom with Idealists who have defined what ""good"" new's is, and now that he has Mac back he's questioning if he agree's with what is ""good"" is (Ep 1 of Season 3 is basically this in the beginning)
* He's fighting with everyone to prove how smart he is rather than showing he gets the idea that everyone is talking about. And the sad inherent thing is he's friggin intelligent (saw the whole FBI thing coming a mile away, and while he's in the room he's fighting with the lawyer to prove he's a better lawyer --&gt; when in reality he told Neil to call her rather than personally representing Neil, because the foresaw there was going to be a time when he's going to need to shelter Neil from the consequences and he can't do that as his lawyer)

What Sorkin is doing this Season is burning down the amazing context he placed Will McAvoy (AKA his Newsroom and the amazing people in it), until all we have left is just a beaten down Will in the corner. And it's going to become brutally obvious that The Newsroom is about Will McAvoy and not his ideas. 

* The trailer when Charlie said he's doing all of this for Mac. (showing he doesn't have the same idealistic belief as everyone else)
* Charlie is a father figure he never had and he constantly craves his opinion. 
* The Don Quijote metaphor. We took it as everyone who was in The Newsroom is Don Quijote for being outlaw News figures. But Will still thinks he alone is Don Quijote.

641,"It is REESE Lansing. Also, character discussion. His named is spelled Reese, not any other of these ways y'all are throwing out.  This is the official spelling.  (Well, official according to the Wikipedia page for The Newsroom)

Let's talk about his character for a minute, though.

First of all I'm gonna be a bit biased because I love Chris Messina and I think he's devastatingly sexy.  However, I've always thought Reese was a great character.  They've used him previously as an antagonist- being one of the ""suits"", but in reality he's a guy trying to do his job the same way that the team at ACN is doing theirs.

I can tell by this season that they're really going to be humanizing him though and making him look more and more like a protagonist.

645,"Sorkin speaking to us through Will in s3e01 So I caught onto a subtle theme running through the first episode (I know, just one?) and I wanted to air it out here, see if it sticks.

First, I want to reference [this post from /r/thewestwing,](http://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/2lv58x/filling_the_gap/) which talks about Sorkins motivations for writing the series *Studio 60*, and how he used his personal life to influence the story. It's a good read.

Anyway, there are a few lines in the show that caught my attention. First is in the first few minutes of the show, after Will fails to deliver a rousing speech. Talking to Charlie, Will says ""Why wasn't I able to put my finger on what we're talking about""? ""Because it's obvious"" replies Charlie.

Later, when speaking to Mac about keeping current with the other networks, Will says ""I'm still trying to figure out what doing well means"". Mac replies ""you know what it means"".

I think that Sorkin is lamenting on the current state of this show, and the defeatist attitude he has towards his latest attempt at high-brow television. It's clear that he loves this show, and that he took the negative reviews personally enough to kill the show in only 6 episodes. He know's what good television looks like, and he knows that this show is it. But he doesn't understand why nobody else can see that.

by Robert Herrick

/

GATHER ye rosebuds while ye may,

Old Time is still a-flying:

And this same flower that smiles to-day

To-morrow will be dying.

/

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,

The higher he 's a-getting,

The sooner will his race be run,

And nearer he's to setting.

/

That age is best which is the first,

When youth and blood are warmer;

But being spent, the worse, and worst

Times still succeed the former.

/

Then be not coy, but use your time,

And while ye may, go marry:

For having lost but once your prime,

You may forever tarry.",0, the newsroom poem now one of my personal favorite to the virgin to make much of time gather ye rosebud by robert herrick gather ye rosebud while ye may old time is still a flying and this same flower that smile to day to morrow will be dying the glorious lamp of heaven the sun the higher he s a getting the sooner will his race be run and nearer he s to setting that age is best which is the first when youth and blood are warmer but being spent the worse and worst time still succeed the former then be not coy but use your time and while ye may go marry for having lost but once your prime you may forever tarry, the newsroom poem now one of my person favorit to the virgin to make much of time gather ye rosebud by robert herrick gather ye rosebud while ye may old time is still a fli and thi same flower that smile to day to morrow will be die the gloriou lamp of heaven the sun the higher he s a get the sooner will hi race be run and nearer he s to set that age is best which is the first when youth and blood are warmer but be spent the wors and worst time still succeed the former then be not coy but use your time and while ye may go marri for have lost but onc your prime you may forev tarri

837,"What do we want this subreddit to be about? I currently belong to a lot of different show subreddits (mainly /r/BreakingBad, /r/SonsofAnarchy, /r/Lost, /r/Madmen, and /r/TWD), and I have to admit that this one is at times my least favorite to post to. In my opinion, what truly makes show subreddits great is the discussion that revolves around the show. What worked, what didn't, what we liked, and what we didn't. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be the same here.

It seems that in order to be heard on this subreddit, you must truly love the show and never say anything bad about it. This has become very obvious during the last few episodes, as those who post anything critical about the show are downvoted into obscurity and rarely acknowledged by one or two individuals who truly seem interested in discussing the merits of the show. 

We as a community have a chance to shape this place. Would we rather discuss the show that we all enjoy despite all of its faults, or would we rather just talk about how awesome it is and how infallible Sorkin and the cast are? It is our choice.

I will no doubt catch some flak and be seen as just some bleeding heart who wants everyone to get along, blah blah blah he just wants karma, etc. The truth is, I would just rather come to this subreddit for honest discussion and critique rather than mindless ""OMG SLOANE AND DON 4EVER!"" posts. The downvote is used here as a way to show that you disagree with someone rather than an actual post, and that only hurts the overall discussion and by extension the subreddit as a whole. I could care less about my karma, I care about the product that comes from this subreddit.

Just something to think about. It's a long time until season 3, and if this subpar content continues until then, this subreddit likely won't make it.

851,"Will on being a Republican. [Spoilers S2E9] In a previous episode, Will says he only seems liberal because he believes that hurricanes are caused by barometric pressure and not gay marriage.  A good one-liner, but obviously not nearly enough to satisfy many critics of the show whining about Sorkin's liberal bias.

Finally, in the season 2 finale, Will expands on this a lot more after asking Taylor to take him apart.  I thought his monologue in this episode had a lot more substance and less ""zing"" than past references to his political stance.  And in the same scene, he's defending not only his own beliefs, but also ACN's strategy in covering the news, and by proxy, the so-called ""liberal media"".

Do I think it will shut the critics up?  Of course not, but I do finally feel that this subject got the treatment it deserves on the show.

People are beginning to fit the characters better and the darker tone, with fallible, less smugly omniscient and preachy characters is working much better. There are still elements that aren't working, Sloane the character just doesn't work with Olivia Munn, Mackenzie is a pretty boring character and not using Emily Mortimer's talents very well.

1. Solomon Handcock. This will probably be part of season 3 if they report on Edward Snowden.

2. Trolls and death threats. Are the threats real? Will the people responsible caught? Again, they could connect this with Anonymous in season 3.

3. TMI and Reese. Did they shut down TMI? Did Reese donate any money to a school? I would be fun to see TMI go online only, ala ""Newsweek"", after it's disclosed to Leona that the print version has been losing money for months.

4. Jennifer Johnson. What happened to her after the incident at North Western? Did she have to sign anything to prevent her from suing Will or AWM before she could be an intern? It wouldn't have been a big issue but lawyers don't like loose ends.

5. Did Gary ever take protection money when he worked at TMI? Did he ever witness it directly or was it just office gossip? Not that I want another lawsuit story but it would be interesting to see his character get into trouble for his past indiscretions.

915,"The origin of the name ""Red Team"" - odd Sorkin mistake I guess I've gotten used to Sorkin being pretty good at his own fact checking. Sure he makes mistakes but this one is really bizarre. 

I'll caveat by saying that I'm not a journalist, but I feel pretty confident on this.

In ""Red Team III"" (S02E07) the origin of the term ""Red Team"" is explained as representing ""the red blood cells that clean up after white blood cells do their work""

At which point my head exploded, because it's such an incredibly contrived idea. 

Anyone who's been anywhere even *close* to the military can tell you that a ""red team"" is when you get your own people to represent the enemy to test your own tactics. It's from the Cold War, when the only opponent we had were the Soviets. The term is so pervasive through three decades of military strategy that *I* am aware of that at no point did it enter my mind this season that ""Red Team"" meant anything but ""we set up an opposition team of our own people to attack our story""

Hrm. 

When I was writing this, I was going to comment that if the opfor concept started today, they'd probably represent China and be called a ""Yellow Team"" except that's not PC, so they'd probably call them something else. 

Now I'm wondering if Sorkin knew the military called them ""Red Teams"" but not the origin, so he contacted a military guy to ask the question. And then I surmised that, in light of modern PCism, maybe the *military* gives this explanation of the origin of the term nowadays to avoid saying that our opposition forces are still named after the Soviets.

919,"Now that the Genoa plot has culminated, how will the rest of the show play out? During this whole second season I've been yearning for a show more like what we saw during season one. 

I think the conditions are perfect for this change. We've been on a hiatus from doing real news and breaking stories, and the ACN crew has to win back the audience's trust. The show will return to doing what it was meant to do, and the characters can stop being exhausted, worried, and anxious (a la Maggie, Jim, Charlie).

I think this Genoa plot was a great idea. It really brought in the characters to have us learn what they are like and how they act; something we wouldn't get from the former style of the show. 

I also think that Genoa was strategically placed in an dry area of news. If I'm correct, the date of the show currently is September 2012. Edward Snowden's NSA leak happens in late 2012.

921,"Thaddeus McCotter's Resignation Statement Don Keefer quoted in his depo speech last night: “Today I have resigned from the office of United States Representative for Michigan’s 11th Congressional District.

After nearly 26 years in elected office, this past nightmarish month and a half have, for the first time, severed the necessary harmony between the needs of my constituency and of my family. As this harmony is required to serve, its absence requires I leave.

The recent event’s totality of calumnies, indignities and deceits have weighed most heavily upon my family. Thus, acutely aware one cannot rebuild their hearth of home amongst the ruins of their U.S. House office, for the sake of my loved ones I must “strike another match, go start anew” by embracing the promotion back from public servant to sovereign citizen.

I do not leave for an existing job and face diminishing prospects (and am both unwilling and ill-suited to lobby), my priorities are twofold: find gainful employment to help provide for my family; and continue to assist, in any way they see fit, the Michigan Attorney General’s earnest and thorough investigation, which I requested, into the 2012 petition filing.

While our family takes this step into the rest of our lives, we do so with the ultimate confidence in our country’s future. True, as at other times in the life of our nation, we live in an Age of Extremes that prizes intensity over sanity; rhetoric over reality; and destruction over creation. But this too shall pass, thanks to the infinite, inspired wisdom of the sovereign people who, with God’s continued blessings, will again affirm for the generations American Exceptionalism.

Truly, it is a challenging and fortunate time to live in our blessed sanctuary of liberty.

In closing, to The People of Michigan’s 11th Congressional District, I can but say this: Thank you for the privilege of having worked for you.”

Years ago I started a little passion project of trying to reconstruct a floor plan of the set of The West Wing from screencaps I took off the DVD special feature tour of the set. A recent rewatch of the series sparked my drive to start working on cleaning it up some more in Photoshop and adding to it. The set was built with doors galore and lots of extra space that could get used for future changes, and it's fun to see different little areas appear and evolve throughout the series. The most obvious is the creation of a whole press bullpen area for season 5, but there's other interesting things like the fact that they finally showed where at least one bathroom is in season 5, too. I just wanted to share my progress and maybe start some interesting conversations about what the reddit WW community thinks of the way the set evolved over the years.

1046,"A new style of rewatch Spoilers, if it matters. 

I will preface this by saying I am a die hard fan of the show and have watched it back to front many times. Recently I realized that the last couple times I did a real rewatch I stopped after season 4 because I dreaded the second half of the show so much. In an attempt to reinvigorate myself on seasons 5-7 I decided to start this round ON season 5. 

It’s been a revelation. I honestly am really enjoying it. I think I was so attached to the core team that I just couldn’t accept seeing others on the screen. And the schism between Josh and Toby always depressed me. Don’t get me wrong, still hate that plot point, but I can appreciate the device it is a little more this time. And I really enjoy watching Santos and Vinick. I think they are great characters and are each acted extremely well. I also love seeing Donna and Josh finally get
together. 

Anyways, just wanted to share in case anyone else has avoided the last couple seasons for awhile. Try them on their own without immediately coming off the good stuff.

1055,"Reflecting on the impact this show had on me, particularly President Bartlet and Leo. I’m 46, a former Republican, now progressive. I know characters are an amalgamation of writing, performance, editing etc.  But like many, when I see Martin Sheen I see President Bartlet.  Martin Sheen and John Spencer left an indelible mark on me as those two characters. Somehow I felt so comfortable with them that I would see them in my dreams on occasion. Somehow we’d have already met and quickly fell into pleasant conversation. 

I credit the show with a change in my view of government. One where positive change could be effected even if only in small steps. I later went on to live in Denmark and saw firsthand what a government can be like that regularly strives to improve life for all of its citizens.  

In these days it could easily be dismissed as a pipe dream but it doesn’t have to be. If we choose to fight for the better version of ourselves and push for a better version of this country it _is_ possible to make things actually better. Not just better for some, not just a temporary superficial better but one grounded in our most fundamental values like the golden rule. There are plenty of bad actors prepared to create and maintain a lopsided version of “good” but I firmly believe there are more of us who want to see a better future for all.  

Watching the video that was just released featuring several celebrities including Martin Sheen reminded me not the let my anger get the better of me. Leading me into a smoldering stupor.  It reminded me to keep my eyes clear, support this vision of the future in every way I can and not succumb to the cynicism of the age that tells us real change, real justice are fairytales.

* Introduces Will, who is one of the strongest pieces of the ensemble in the latter half of the series

1076,"H.Con-172 I rewatched ""H. Con-172"" last night, and two questions occurred to me:

(1)  After the deal offered by Calley (acceptance of censure in exchange for ending the hearings), presumably at the behest of the Speaker of the House (established later to have been Walken by this time, I think) and the rest of the Republican leadership, why wouldn't Rep. Gibson have gone ahead and leaked the story (of Leo's getting soused on the night of the last debate) anyway?  I know the real answer is that it would have been inconsistent with the plot directions the writers wanted to go, but it just seems unrealistic to me.  The portrayal of Gibson up to that point makes it almost certain in my mind that he would have disclosed, the deal notwithstanding.

(2)  How would the rest of S3 have played out if Bartlet hadn't accepted the deal?  Would it have made the election storyline more compelling?",1, h con 172 i rewatched h con 172 last night and two question occurred to me 1 after the deal offered by calley acceptance of censure in exchange for ending the hearing presumably at the behest of the speaker of the house established later to have been walken by this time i think and the rest of the republican leadership why wouldn t rep gibson have gone ahead and leaked the story of leo s getting soused on the night of the last debate anyway i know the real answer is that it would have been inconsistent with the plot direction the writer wanted to go but it just seems unrealistic to me the portrayal of gibson up to that point make it almost certain in my mind that he would have disclosed the deal notwithstanding 2 how would the rest of s3 have played out if bartlet hadn t accepted the deal would it have made the election storyline more compelling, h con 172 i rewatch h con 172 last night and two question occur to me 1 after the deal offer by calley accept of censur in exchang for end the hear presum at the behest of the speaker of the hous establish later to have been walken by thi time i think and the rest of the republican leadership whi wouldn t rep gibson have gone ahead and leak the stori of leo s get sous on the night of the last debat anyway i know the real answer is that it would have been inconsist with the plot direct the writer want to go but it just seem unrealist to me the portray of gibson up to that point make it almost certain in my mind that he would have disclos the deal notwithstand 2 how would the rest of s3 have play out if bartlet hadn t accept the deal would it have made the elect storylin more compel

&amp;#x200B;

I had made several years ago this little compilation video that I called ""the road to the Santos White House"" picking out a few of the most key scenes during seasons 6 and 7 that highlighted the start to finish on Matt Santos becoming the new POTUS at the end of the series. It was about 15 minutes long but because how many channel was as the time, I had to split it into 2 parts. And they got a fair amount of views over the years but for the last 18 months or so I'd had this itch to completely remake it, but going quite a bit deeper. Though even being almost an hour long, I could have it in one neat, contained video. I'm happy enough with how the final cut came out, but Youtube wouldn't even let me upload it, for surely obvious reasons. I don't know how these channels that primarily feature fan edited compilations with tons of TV show or film footage are able to last on there. The last few times I've tried something, it gets flagged immediately. Anyway, this is why I'm presenting this now from my Vimeo page, as much as I would've preferred Youtube. They're far more lenient, but obviously not nearly as popular.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the revamping of this whole concept I wanted to do it in a way similar in size to what would've been a West Wing episode itself, of course a wee bit longer hahaa... more like an episode length from a cable series.

X percent of people say A and y percentage of people say B.

1151,"Help: What was the one...? Hi all.  I'm not a regular but since WW portrays so many things so brilliantly, I'd really love to find an episode name or scene link to something that's stuck in my mind.

I'm pretty sure this was on West Wing (because no other show dealing with D.C. is smart enough) where someone (I think maybe it was Toby) was meeting with some Congress members' staff members at a restaurant.  The thing that sticks out, and what I want the example of, is that these two douchebags were so full of themselves that they were adjusting the menu in the most conceited ways possible.  Here they were at a VERY nice restaurant, obviously led by extremely capable chefs, and they both had to make a big show of how they knew better than the chef how to make their dishes.  Brilliant portrayal of the kind of madness that positions of power attracts.

Does this sound familiar?  I sure hope I have the right show.  Thanks in advance.

In know many people cite “Two Cathedrals” and some others as their favorite episodes, and for good reason, but I wanted to state my love for “20 Hours in America.” Taken together, Parts 1 and 2 are a brilliant play by Sorkin, featuring amazing profiles of so many of the cast in some of their finest moments. Especially great profiles are shown for Charlie, Debbie, C.J., and Donna; but for me it’s always Sam. Schmutzy Pants is my guy, and this two-parter is my favorite West Wing watch—outshining even ""Somebody's Going to Emergency, Somebody's Going to Jail"" for peak Seaborn.

The character I love to hate is Amy. I really can't understand why some people think she and Josh make a great couple. I mean, sure, their relationship is pretty passionate and they are equally intelligent/ambitious, but I think she crosses the line when she dumps Josh's phone in soup and cuts the phone cord.  That's some alarming behavior right there, and I'd recommend they both go see a therapist IRL. The only thing I appreciate about the Amy character is that she is such a stark contrast to Donna that she helps the viewers (me, at least) realize how much better Donna is for Josh.

I am halfway through season 6 but have gone ahead and spoiled myself to learn that Josh and Donna don’t get together until midway through season 7.  

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve enjoyed the slow burn. But I do find it rather puzzling that throughout the length of the show they have these big moments of almost admitting or realizing their feelings for each other only for there to be another season long stretch of little to no movement for them. It seems a bit excessive and frustrating at times. 

I can understand not wanting to pull the trigger on them too early, but waiting until the last half of the final (SEVEN) season seems almost unfairly rushed for the sake of wrapping the show up. 

So I guess I’m wondering, from the creative standpoint was this the plan for them all along? Or was there no plan? We’re they unsure of what they wanted to do with them if they ever put them together? I’m just looking for more insight into this entire relationship behind the camera.

1267,"The West Wing easter egg that I so wish WAS one but couldn't possibly actually BE one Alright folks, I'm putting my West Wing nerd-level to a bit of a test here lol... (&amp; btw, my background Twitter pic has always been the group shot from the s7 premiere of them standing outside the Bartlet library). I got an inch a few weeks ago to revisit the season 4 episodes surrounding the reelection. In 04x07 *Election Night*, Sam is making his first confession to another staff member (Donna) about the offer he made to Will Bailey that he'd be the Democrat to run should the utter impossibility of the deceased Horton Wilde winning the main election happen.

&amp;#x200B;

He says to Donna, *""This wasn't going to cost me anything. They weren't gonna announce unless Wilde won, and that was never gonna happen in Orange County. It's like the Secretary Of Agriculture saying 'Sure, I'm ready to assume the Presidency, should the 18 who come before me DIE'. So why not?""*

&amp;#x200B;

It kinda stuck in my head for a little bit that that number seemed a little familiar to something. Then it hit me. In the absolutely legendary episode 02x18 *17 People*, after Toby's finally been given the whole story about Bartlet's MS diagnosis, he points out that the number of people who were already aware being 16 wasn't strictly accurate, that Bartlet himself knew. Making it 17 people. Which, of course, would make one Mr. Toby Ziegler the 18th person to know. (and there's the added little kicker that the episode itself was the 18th of the season)

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as that kicked in, I had this ""oh my god that's too perfect"" moment, followed all of about 7 seconds later by ""okay moron, be real, that is WAY too friggin obscure of a thing that someone did that on purpose"" lol  Still, I love to think that Aaron Sorkin when he was writing this, knew he could just pick a totally random number to make Sam's line work, and somehow the synapses fired just right to make THAT be the reason he picked 18 :)",1, the west wing easter egg that i so wish wa one but couldn t possibly actually be one alright folk i m putting my west wing nerd level to a bit of a test here lol amp btw my background twitter pic ha always been the group shot from the s7 premiere of them standing outside the bartlet library i got an inch a few week ago to revisit the season 4 episode surrounding the reelection in 04x07 election night sam is making his first confession to another staff member donna about the offer he made to will bailey that he d be the democrat to run should the utter impossibility of the deceased horton wilde winning the main election happen amp x200b he say to donna this wasn t going to cost me anything they weren t gonna announce unless wilde won and that wa never gonna happen in orange county it s like the secretary of agriculture saying sure i m ready to assume the presidency should the 18 who come before me die so why not amp x200b it kinda stuck in my head for a little bit that that number seemed a little familiar to something then it hit me in the absolutely legendary episode 02x18 17 people after toby s finally been given the whole story about bartlet s m diagnosis he point out that the number of people who were already aware being 16 wasn t strictly accurate that bartlet himself knew making it 17 people which of course would make one mr toby ziegler the 18th person to know and there s the added little kicker that the episode itself wa the 18th of the season amp x200b a soon a that kicked in i had this oh my god that s too perfect moment followed all of about 7 second later by okay moron be real that is way too friggin obscure of a thing that someone did that on purpose lol still i love to think that aaron sorkin when he wa writing this knew he could just pick a totally random number to make sam s line work and somehow the synapsis fired just right to make that be the reason he picked 18, the west wing easter egg that i so wish wa one but couldn t possibl actual be one alright folk i m put my west wing nerd level to a bit of a test here lol amp btw my background twitter pic ha alway been the group shot from the s7 premier of them stand outsid the bartlet librari i got an inch a few week ago to revisit the season 4 episod surround the reelect in 04x07 elect night sam is make hi first confess to anoth staff member donna about the offer he made to will bailey that he d be the democrat to run should the utter imposs of the deceas horton wild win the main elect happen amp x200b he say to donna thi wasn t go to cost me anyth they weren t gonna announc unless wild won and that wa never gonna happen in orang counti it s like the secretari of agricultur say sure i m readi to assum the presid should the 18 who come befor me die so whi not amp x200b it kinda stuck in my head for a littl bit that that number seem a littl familiar to someth then it hit me in the absolut legendari episod 02x18 17 peopl after tobi s final been given the whole stori about bartlet s ms diagnosi he point out that the number of peopl who were alreadi awar be 16 wasn t strictli accur that bartlet himself knew make it 17 peopl which of cours would make one mr tobi ziegler the 18th person to know and there s the ad littl kicker that the episod itself wa the 18th of the season amp x200b as soon as that kick in i had thi oh my god that s too perfect moment follow all of about 7 second later by okay moron be real that is way too friggin obscur of a thing that someon did that on purpos lol still i love to think that aaron sorkin when he wa write thi knew he could just pick a total random number to make sam s line work and somehow the synaps fire just right to make that be the reason he pick 18

I love The West Wing. I started watching it due to my interest in geopolitics. I watched Newsroom before this. Loved its screenplay and dialogue. And then learnt, Sorkin, the creator excels at workplace dramas. And then I found TWW. It's my all time favorite show. I have atleast watched it 3 times in full. And watch few YouTube videos from time to time. It's kind of a solace for me these days whenever I listen to the news. Haha.

So, I started observing this behavior of mine few weeks ago. I would play a random YouTube video. Before the character says it, I will say it, almost with the same intonation. This is madness!  

Some of my friends know about my love for TWW. So, I pinged few of them and also shared this behavior of mine. Now, sharing with fellow TWW fans. Do any of you have any similar behavior? I don't really care for it but I never thought I will be passionate about anything this seriously. Haha

1. ""We need to have a discussion and we need to have it tonight.""   &lt;----Multiple people are adamant that there must be a discussion and yet there was never a discussion
2. ""It's answer B"" &lt;----Josh tells Toby that the president isn't running again and we go to commercial and come back after the interview where President Barlet tells the world he has MS (Side note, the TV interviewer didn't ask if he was going to run again?)
3. ""First row, first seat on your right"" &lt;---CJ is adamant that the president needs a softball question about his health when it's already been stated that ""it's answer B"" (Which we would assume the interviewer would have asked about)
4. No one in The West Wing (the support staff) seems to have a reaction to the President admitting he has MS even though we're told that 60% of Democrats won't vote for him because he lied by Joey Lucas (played by the amazing Marlee Matlin)

&amp;#x200B;

So the president lied. His staff is upset that he lied. Then they all demand they form a plan together and the **president cuts them out again** (makes the decision without them). Then &lt;spoiler&gt; he completely changes his mind again after telling no one.

1352,"So like am I the only one who’s HATES Will and Donna during seasons 6-7??? So personally, I liked the characters for a big amount of time until 1.) Will got hired by the VP 2.) Donna joined the VP campaign. Here’s why:

- Will just seemed like such a pain in the ass, for example during Bartlet’s trip to China during 6x09 and 6x10. The president has an MS episode and while there are already physicians etc lined up to speak to the press, Will takes this as a time to make sure the VP gives a statement and the damn VP goes along with it and just to stick the knife in further, Russell uses that damn line about playing tennis when he heard the news, it just seemed to me that neither Russell nor Will had any type of respect for the president or the country since this clearly was a campaign stunt for them. Another instance was when during the SAME episode, they tried holding a damn cabinet meeting where they clearly were going to try and invoke the 25th amendment on Bartlet. That just showed so much disrespect and left a sour taste in my mouth.

- Another instance was when baker visited the White House and Will inserted Russell into the photo op to avoid it only being Bartlet and baker. Bartlet himself even told Russell never to do that again, he even said that he wasn’t choosing between either of them so it wasn’t even anything to do with the campaign just baker and the president taking a photo with some historic thing (I forgot what it was). Personally, I think Bartlet should’ve fired Will’s ass after that incident. It’s still his administration and still him governing till the final minute. 

- Donna really came off to me as annoying and full of herself when the New Hampshire primaries came around. She didn’t finish college and just expected a promotion to come her way because she worked in the White House under Josh for a long time. Will coming up to her with a job offer was definitely a little punch at Josh and Donna accepting was also a big backstab. She considered herself to be on Josh’s level of expertise just because Will gave her a job, she wasn’t even in charge of anything. I remember one quote from 6x11 where she says sarcastically “Yes, I let Will seduce me with a salary and actual political support” political support how?? Bingo bob had none lmao it’s why his ass was neck and neck with Santos at the convention. She’s literally just working on media targeting like come on. She makes it seem as if she’s on the same level now and tries to throw it all in Josh’s face. 

Another moment that really irritates me is when she tries to get a job at the santos campaign and she tries to dismiss the comments she made about santos during the campaign as “doing her job”. The quote that really pissed me off was her saying “You’re not used to seeing me in a position of power, I can see how that makes you uncomfortable.” It’s not even that, it’s the fact that she felt a little bit of power and instead of using it for good like Josh she used it to slander opponents and gain a few fractions in the polls. It put a smile on my face when josh didn’t even let her get past the interview stage. She Deserved every bit of that.

Final case: they’re both shitty characters in the end tbh. It kinda pissed me off that she ended up working for the campaign and santos administration in the end but oh well. The fact that Josh didn’t even ask Will to stay on was also pretty dope tbh. Sucks that he became a congressman later on, I feel that more than likely josh didn’t tell santos to help him out when he started campaigning. If he helped Russell more than likely he shared some views with the VP.
",1, so like am i the only one who s hate will and donna during season 6 7 so personally i liked the character for a big amount of time until 1 will got hired by the vp 2 donna joined the vp campaign here s why will just seemed like such a pain in the as for example during bartlet s trip to china during 6x09 and 6x10 the president ha an m episode and while there are already physician etc lined up to speak to the press will take this a a time to make sure the vp give a statement and the damn vp go along with it and just to stick the knife in further russell us that damn line about playing tennis when he heard the news it just seemed to me that neither russell nor will had any type of respect for the president or the country since this clearly wa a campaign stunt for them another instance wa when during the same episode they tried holding a damn cabinet meeting where they clearly were going to try and invoke the 25th amendment on bartlet that just showed so much disrespect and left a sour taste in my mouth another instance wa when baker visited the white house and will inserted russell into the photo op to avoid it only being bartlet and baker bartlet himself even told russell never to do that again he even said that he wasn t choosing between either of them so it wasn t even anything to do with the campaign just baker and the president taking a photo with some historic thing i forgot what it wa personally i think bartlet should ve fired will s as after that incident it s still his administration and still him governing till the final minute donna really came off to me a annoying and full of herself when the new hampshire primary came around she didn t finish college and just expected a promotion to come her way because she worked in the white house under josh for a long time will coming up to her with a job offer wa definitely a little punch at josh and donna accepting wa also a big backstab she considered herself to be on josh s level of expertise just because will gave her a job she wasn t even in charge of anything i remember one quote from 6x11 where she say sarcastically yes i let will seduce me with a salary and actual political support political support how bingo bob had none lmao it s why his as wa neck and neck with santos at the convention she s literally just working on medium targeting like come on she make it seem a if she s on the same level now and try to throw it all in josh s face another moment that really irritates me is when she try to get a job at the santos campaign and she try to dismiss the comment she made about santos during the campaign a doing her job the quote that really pissed me off wa her saying you re not used to seeing me in a position of power i can see how that make you uncomfortable it s not even that it s the fact that she felt a little bit of power and instead of using it for good like josh she used it to slander opponent and gain a few fraction in the poll it put a smile on my face when josh didn t even let her get past the interview stage she deserved every bit of that final case they re both shitty character in the end tbh it kinda pissed me off that she ended up working for the campaign and santos administration in the end but oh well the fact that josh didn t even ask will to stay on wa also pretty dope tbh suck that he became a congressman later on i feel that more than likely josh didn t tell santos to help him out when he started campaigning if he helped russell more than likely he shared some view with the vp, so like am i the onli one who s hate will and

1353,"""Lies, Damn Lies &amp; Statistics"" So in Season 1 Episode 2 - Sam tells Laurie ""There isn't a BAR in America that's going to admit you with a solicitation bust on your record""

&amp;#x200B;

And then in Episode 21 of Season 1 - We find out that the picture of Sam and Laurie was setup by her friend who also confirmed to the media outlet that published it that she was a call girl.

&amp;#x200B;

When the President finds out, he says he will personally see to it that the A.G. admits her to the BAR.

&amp;#x200B;

So, by meeting with Laurie (after being told not to) and using her friend - Is it possible Sam basically ruined the career of a would-be lawyer before it could have even gotten started? And after she had claimed she only was a call girl to pay for law school (which is now worthless and she did all of that illegal activity for nothing).

1363,"So I rewatched season 7’s last few episodes...Santo’s is such an ass**** The last season is passable, I enjoyed the whole campaign plot and what not. I just didn’t end up liking santos as much as I did when we first meet him in season 6. Here are a few reasons and ill try to cite certain episodes.

- He treats josh like a second thought even though this is the guy that pretty much got him to the fucking White House. For example in 7x09, we have a bunch of people recommending that josh be let go as campaign manager, and santos just takes it and doesn’t try to defend him at all. I think it’s BS that he ended up turning his back on him like that, I especially hated that he took Goodwin’s advice when Goodwin tried acting like an alley to josh earlier in that episode. (More on how much I hate Goodwin later.)

- Goodwin comes out of nowhere and honestly has no real connection to Santos during the campaign. Yet for whatever reason santo’s always seems to go along with Goodwin like when wanted to head the transition team he let him do it. Or when he wanted josh replaced by Leo as campaign manager, he once again willingly listened. I remember during the speaker race that josh wanted santo’s to remain neutral but santos kept mentioning how Goodwin thought he should throw his support behind his old pal. It just seems to me that santo’s didn’t feel as if he were in josh’s debt and that the only person that’s really looking out for him is josh.

Overall, it’s not surprising that so many AU’s have santos being a one term president tbh. He’s just so damn flip floppy when it comes to his own team especially josh and tbh if Goodwin was a part of his administration then that for sure concludes that his presidency would’ve been one term. He’s more willing to listen to anyone that he thinks has something important to say when really the only one who should be helping him out is his chief of staff which is josh.
Even he realizes that santos is looking for a yes man during the transition which I personally think is ridiculous.",1, so i rewatched season 7 s last few episode santo s is such an as the last season is passable i enjoyed the whole campaign plot and what not i just didn t end up liking santos a much a i did when we first meet him in season 6 here are a few reason and ill try to cite certain episode he treat josh like a second thought even though this is the guy that pretty much got him to the fucking white house for example in 7x09 we have a bunch of people recommending that josh be let go a campaign manager and santos just take it and doesn t try to defend him at all i think it s b that he ended up turning his back on him like that i especially hated that he took goodwin s advice when goodwin tried acting like an alley to josh earlier in that episode more on how much i hate goodwin later goodwin come out of nowhere and honestly ha no real connection to santos during the campaign yet for whatever reason santo s always seems to go along with goodwin like when wanted to head the transition team he let him do it or when he wanted josh replaced by leo a campaign manager he once again willingly listened i remember during the speaker race that josh wanted santo s to remain neutral but santos kept mentioning how goodwin thought he should throw his support behind his old pal it just seems to me that santo s didn t feel a if he were in josh s debt and that the only person that s really looking out for him is josh overall it s not surprising that so many au s have santos being a one term president tbh he s just so damn flip floppy when it come to his own team especially josh and tbh if goodwin wa a part of his administration then that for sure concludes that his presidency would ve been one term he s more willing to listen to anyone that he think ha something important to say when really the only one who should be helping him out is his chief of staff which is josh even he realizes that santos is looking for a yes man during the transition which i personally think is ridiculous, so i rewatch season 7 s last few episod santo s is such an ass the last season is passabl i enjoy the whole campaign plot and what not i just didn t end up like santo as much as i did when we first meet him in season 6 here are a few reason and ill tri to cite certain episod he treat josh like a second thought even though thi is the guy that pretti much got him to the fuck white hous for exampl in 7x09 we have a bunch of peopl recommend that josh be let go as campaign manag and santo just take it and doesn t tri to defend him at all i think it s bs that he end up turn hi back on him like that i especi hate that he took goodwin s advic when goodwin tri act like an alley to josh earlier in that episod more on how much i hate goodwin later goodwin come out of nowher and honestli ha no real connect to santo dure the campaign yet for whatev reason santo s alway seem to go along with goodwin like when want to head the transit team he let him do it or when he want josh replac by leo as campaign manag he onc again willingli listen i rememb dure the speaker race that josh want santo s to remain neutral but santo kept mention how goodwin thought he should throw hi support behind hi old pal it just seem to me that santo s didn t feel as if he were in josh s debt and that the onli person that s realli look out for him is josh overal it s not surpris that so mani au s have santo be a one term presid tbh he s just so damn flip floppi when it come to hi own team especi josh and tbh if goodwin wa a part of hi administr then that for sure conclud that hi presid would ve been one term he s more will to listen to anyon that he think ha someth import to say when realli the onli one who should be help him out is hi chief of staff which is josh even he realiz that santo is look for a ye man dure the transit which i person think is ridicul

1368,"Favorite 'weaker' episodes 'Weaker' in quotes because so few of them are weak in any real way compared to anything else on tv, but I mean it more in the sense of 'we can't all be Two Cathedrals'. Are there any less critically acclaimed/generally beloved episodes that you have a soft spot for? Or episodes you think have significant flaws but like for random reasons you can't rationally defend? Or even widely disliked episodes you loved? My best friend just finished watching and put The Long Goodbye in her top 10, which.. surprised me to say the least lol but it got me wondering what other people's unconventional favs are.

I have a lot of them (pretty much the entire Santos primary/general election arc was top tier for me) but the one I love most intensely is Holy Night. It's by far my favorite holiday ep, and one of my favorite eps in general, even though I agree with the consensus that it's objectively (as objective as these things can be) the weakest holiday one of the Sorkin years, and the narrative's symmetry is pretty heavy handed. But Tobby is my favorite character, and I like Mafia stories, Yiddish and a cappella to a degree where when I was first watching it I was like 'wtf was this specifically designed to be my favorite episode'. I also love Santa Danny and the goldfish pin, and lol every time at 'I'm told that on my sunniest of days, I'm not that fun to be around. I wonder what's gonna happen when you make my children a part of your life'. 

Finally this exchange between Toby and Josh for me was one of the most moving of the entire show (and I don't say that lightly for this show):

&gt;\-It was desperation. It wasn't out of a desire to do evil. He had a young family and he barely spoke the language, and he went to jail. He went to jail, and you went to school, and it was all a half-century ago. Look what he did in two generations. What room did you just walk out of?  
&gt;  
&gt;\-I appreciate that that's what you think. Do I get to think what I think?   
&gt;  
&gt;\-No, you don't, cause you don't know what I know.   
&gt;  
&gt;\- What?   
&gt;  
&gt;\-That I would give anything to have a living father who was a felon. Or a sister with a past.

1378,"Shibboleth S2E8 Two highlights of the episode: 

1.) Bartlet giving Charlie the knife. I think it’s one of the most touching scenes in the series. He’s so fond of Charlie and thinks of him as a son (more than his son in law) so much so that he passes along his family knife. Add in that Charlie never had a father figure in his life and you have me in tears. 

2.) CJ growing attached to the turkeys and fighting to get the second one pardoned. 

And it just has some of my favorite quotes:

“We‘d prefer to watch football rather than listen to the history of the yam in Latin.”

“Troy, I want you to know it was neck and neck, but I’m giving it to Eric.”

“I chose Eric cause Troy doesn’t like to be touched which, surely, were not gonna execute him for.”

“Maybe after the ceremony you can get one of the forth graders to come in and show you how to use the intercom.” (I’m so not looking forward to the show w/o Mrs. Landingham) 

“I’m proud of you, Charlie.”

“They sent me two turkeys. The more photo friendly of the two gets a presidential pardon and a full life at a children’s zoo, the runner up gets eaten.”
“If the Oscars were like that, I’d watch.”

Just got to the episode where Josh first approaches Santos about running for President and it got me thinking, who would Josh choose to back for this presidential primary? Who would Toby? Will? Here’s my guesses, I’d love to hear yours! 

*I am not commenting on the actual policies of each candidate and this is Not meant to inspire political debate. I just think it would be fun to explore! 

Josh-  Pete Buttigieg.  I think it plays into his search for an underdog with promise. Buttigieg is a long shot but has so far been rather impressive in town halls.

Toby- Beto O’Rouke. Toby’s monologue to Josh about a candidate not needing to be “convinced” to run and feeling that they are destined for it! Based of O’Roukes recent Vanity Fair article.

Will- Biden. A safe bet and plays into the VP story line. 
 
CJ- Elizabeth Warren. Based off various opinions CJ has voiced through out the series, plus I would imagine she would prefer to support a female candidate.

1465,"Am I alone in thinking Toby's arc makes sense? [SPOILERS] SPOILERS BELOW

I’ve seen many people deride the writers’ decisions for Toby in the last season or two. Richard Schiff was famously bitter for his character’s direction in the final seasons, claiming the writers didn’t understand Toby and wrote him as a “grump.” Some posit that the leak plot-line was meant as punishment for the actor’s demands and comments.

Everything I’ve seen from reddit users regarding Toby and the military shuttle leak share the same sentiment: Toby would never do that, I hate what they did with Toby, they didn’t understand Toby at all.

I am here to present a counter-argument. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the leak subplot, but I loved what they did with Toby and thought it made perfect sense.


First, Toby has always been ethically driven. Over the course of the series, he consistently proves his regard for moral obligations over direct orders. Nothing so drastic as the leak, but from the beginning, Toby is a warrior for righteousness, sometimes to a fault. I love Toby, and consider him one of my favorite characters for this reason. But when Bartlett accuses him of having always considered himself morally superior, I accepted that. I think that’s true.

So am I saying that season 1-3 Toby would have leaked the shuttle? Maybe, but probably not. However, he is not the same man by the time we get to season 7. Let’s look at Toby’s relationships over the course of the series.

When Sam leaves, Toby understands, but it doesn’t make it hurt any less. It was almost like getting a second divorce. His best friend, collaborator, and most trusted colleague left him.

~~At some point, his father dies, though my memory of the timing is foggy.~~

Then, Josh leaves for the Santos campaign, and doesn’t ask Toby to join him. We find out later that this wounded Toby deeply. Another colleague he respects and considers a close friend has vanished. 

Finally, his brother — the astronaut — commits suicide soon after being diagnosed with cancer (I don’t remember exactly where this falls, but it is before any of the leak stuff begins.) In this episode, he is clearly badly affected. It goes without saying that this has a profound and lasting impact on Toby, as it would any of us.
 

So ultimately, as I was watching, I understood S6-7 Toby to be someone who felt abandoned, alone, and beaten down. I think his sense of loyalty to the administration as a body was badly damaged.

So this is the Toby who leaks the shuttle information. A man, judgement skewed by his brother’s recent death, who considers the pursuit of the pure ethical choice to be paramount, greater than any loyalty, makes a decision. He then accepts the consequences, relinquishing neither CJ nor his brother’s reputation as bargaining chips.



I thought it was fantastic. And it added a realistic layer to the show by depriving a main character of a neat, happy ending. Eight years is a long time to spend in that environment. Relationships will fracture, people will change.

I, for one, am a Toby fan to the end.

That opening scene would have become very awkward had Spencer been included in it, or if one of the included actors had died instead.

ABBEY: Do you like these earrings?

BARTLET: [without looking] I do.

ABBEY: You want to look at them first?

BARTLET: [still not looking] Are they new?

ABBEY: No.

BARTLET: [still not looking] You've worn them?

ABBEY: Yeah.

BARTLET: [still into his puzzle] I love them. ""Laissez-faire doctrine."" 15 letters.

ABBEY: Social Darwinism.

BARTLET: No, that's not the answer. See, 'cause Social Darwinism isn't a doctrine. It's a force of nature. The answer is ""libertarianism."" [scribbles down his answer]

ABBEY: I'm gonna be ready in two minutes.

BARTLET: Take your time.

ABBEY: Passive-aggression is not gonna get me out the door any faster.

BARTLET: Boo boo, I gave up on getting you out the door in the late 70's. Plus, it's your 
birthday. You're old, and you don't move around that fast.

ABBEY: Libertarianism has 14 letters not 15.

BARTLET: I know, so I'm shading in the extra box. [scribbles on the puzzle]

ABBEY: And it's not my birthday.

BARTLET: It's your birthday week. It's a week of festivities like Mardi Gras or Lent. Three 
letters. ""It may be bitter."" ""Tea,"" right?

ABBEY: “It may be bitter?""

BARTLET: Yeah.

ABBEY: Why ""tea""?

BARTLET: ‘Cause ""woman"" doesn't fit.

ABBEY: “End,"" you idiot. ""Bitter end.""

BARTLET: Hey, when the Medical Board gives you the results of the hearing, do they slap it up on one of those X-ray light boards? ""Here's where the problem is with your testimony, Abbey. Here and here.""

ABBEY: That! That's funny? The other 23 jokes weren't funny. Well, it's not that they weren't funny. It's just they weren't ha ha funny, you know, but 12 years of medical school, my life, my work, my future, everything, up on the X-ray board? That's comedy!

BARTLET: See, I know it sounds like you're praising me, but...

ABBEY: Oh, shut up.

BARTLET: [pause] It's not your life or 12 years of anything or anything. They're gonna give you the very least they can give you.

ABBEY: They can't give me the very least they can give me. The least they can give me is a letter of concern, which is private and unpublished, but that isn't available to me 
because I fought the case and stood by my convictions.

BARTLET: Well, that was stupid.

ABBEY: Do your crossword puzzle.

BARTLET: Standing by your convictions isn't gonna get you anywhere. This isn't some guy off the street talking. I'm a very successful politician.

ABBEY: How many people are at this party?

BARTLET: About 200, but that was five or six hours ago when it started.

ABBEY: Once more with the passive-aggressive.

her magnificent breasts?

MARBURY:  [*takes two glasses of wine from a waiter and gives one to Abbey*] Abbey, I bring you warm wishes from Her Royal Majesty.

MARBURY: Would that I could deliver the same wishes for you, Mr. President.

BARTLET: What did I do?

MARBURY: Brendan McGann cannot visit the White House.

BARTLET: Look, obviously, we knew this was gonna be a thing, but it doesn't have to be tonight, right?

MARBURY: No, absolutely not. I shall take it up with Gerald.

ABBEY: Who's Gerald?

BARTLET:  I'm pretty sure he means Leo.

AMY: And it's not like it's been a detour from health care.

ABBEY: No.

AMY:  What?  You've expanded Medicare to cover mammograms, cancer clinical trials... That's money that could've gone to Viagra. You were the one that said ""no dice"" to cutting infant nutrition programs, nursing home standards...

C.J.:  There's plenty of stuff left.

AMY : ...child immunizations, juvenile diabetes...

ABBEY: That's not the point.

SAM: Okay. So did I disappoint you when I didn't go into physics?

MILLGATE: No.

SAM: Why?

MILLGATE: You were bad at it.

SAM: No, I wasn't.

MILLGATE:  Yeah.

SAM: I just needed a little encouragement.

MILLGATE: No.

SAM:  Look, Congress isn't gonna fund your damn Superconductor, all right?

MILLGATE: Supercollider. Superconducting Supercollider. This is exactly what I'm talking about. A 54-mile tunnel, 150 feet below ground in which protons and antiprotons would be flung into each other at the speed of light. Can you remember that?

SAM: Yes.

MILLGATE: Good 'cause when you talk about it, you should sound like an idiot.

SAM: Okay.

——— Excerpt From Later In The Scene———

SAM: All right. Listen.

MILLGATE: Yes? 

SAM: Well, first of all, you're not allowed to smoke in the White House.

MILLGATE: You're kidding?

SAM: No.

MILLGATE: And the search for civilization continues.

SAM:  Come outside.  I need you to tell me everything you can tell me about the Superconducting Supercollider.

MILLGATE: How much time do we have?

SAM: About ten minutes.

MILLGATE:  **If you pay close attention, stay very, very quiet, I can teach you how to spell it.**

Yeah. I know, that was a lot, but there’s still so many more scenes. 

Here’s a few **Honorable mentions:**

*Ditch Digger Scene- Charlie and The President work on his toast.*

BARTLET: Okay. Here we go.

CHARLIE: Time is tight.

BARTLET: That's when the juices get flowing.

CHARLIE: I'm not sure we have time for juices, sir

BARTLET: I could tell the story of the ditch digger.

CHARLIE: Sir?

BARTLET: You know the story?

CHARLIE: I do not.

BARTLET: Abbey and I were walking along and we see a ditch digger, and I said, ""Aren't you glad you married me? You could've married a ditch digger."" And she said, ""Jed, if I'd married him, he'd be President."" What do you think?

CHARLIE: Not so sure, sir.

BARTLET: Why?

CHARLIE: ‘Cause it seems like a story about how cool you are.

Leo approaches The President while he’s working on his toast with Charlie.

[*Bartlet and Leo walk away*]

LEO: What's gonna happen?

BARTLET: They're gonna suspend her license for a year.

LEO: We just talked for a little bit.

BARTLET: And?

LEO: I don't think you need to be concerned about her leaving you for me.

BARTLET: I was pretty concerned about that.

LEO: She's definitely leaving you for somebody, so don't be so...

BARTLET: Can you leave me alone? I'm trying to be a husband, and your mojo's getting all over me.

I always find this as an interesting take and really my answer is “Yes, sure I’d love to see more Sorkin-esque Presidential Debates”, but I just realized that the episodes this is really highlighted in occur post Sorkin years? Yes, this does come up during Bartlet’s re-election campaign but not as detailed prominently yet ‘The Newsroom’ has the exact same almost verbatim view on this in season one. 

This leaves me with two questions. 

Does anyone else feel that Aaron Sorkin’s view on “Debating” really is a great one that should be enacted? Would this make a difference and is it actually possible? 

And is this truly Sorkin’s view, since he claims to have never watched the post Sorkin years on TWW and plays out this exact debate fantasy on ‘The Newsroom’ ?

1541,"Sorkin and speechwriters To all my American friends - I would like to understand how important is the role of a speechwriter in the White House, when it comes to policy. I would think that it would be policy decisions that would affect speech writing and not the other way.

But Sorkin on his shows portrays a very high importance on these roles- Toby and Sam in TWW (Sam was supposed to be the main lead in the beginning of the show) and even Will in the newsroom.

1550,"Following along with all the Reboot Idea’s.... Doesn’t Congresswoman Wyatt make a lot of sense? [Andrea Wyatt(-Ziegler?) for president](https://imgur.com/a/b37VSw6)

[I was Inspired by this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/asy9jq/if_were_giving_reboot_ideas_heres_mine/?st=JSG9YL1X&amp;sh=f8afdc07) and then thought to myself seriously wouldn’t Congresswoman Wyatt make an excellent POTUS storyline in a reboot: 

1. A Female President ✔️ 

•Follows almost all current TV network trends.

•Definitely could serve to add even more to Sorkin’s specific brand of political idealism. 

2. She automatically injects countless opportunities for conflict. Her campaigning alone would takes us through numerous rollercoasters and of course even more while she was in office ✔️ 

•First off Toby’s connection to her alone serves this purpose. 

•Add in those pregnancy lawsuits. 

•Even her own season 7 (likely)come from behind congressional win, after having always won her district with 85% of the vote, all because Toby was charged. 

3. Andy Wyatt definitely provides probably the most legitimate reason’s to include or call back to serve, most if not all of the original ensemble ✔️ 

•They all served as trusted advisors to Bartlet together (think Debate Camp). 

•They all seemed to be roughly the same age/generation. This makes a lot more sense if you think about it-Bringing back what would be considered a much older administration with Charlie young as President would be harder if they all came right back into the WH and with Wyatt this plus they could all maybe even return with some as Sr staff. This is just more plausible with her. 

•Wyatt already worked with all of these political operatives why would she even change that? 

4. Wyatt would even be one of the easiest way’s for Sorkin to write the party politics the same way he did in the original ✔️ 

•Her political views mostly lined up with Bartlet’s Administration. 

•Her history would have obviously much more likely stayed the same course politically. 

5.She even sorta opens the door a little wider for old recurring only characters. 

•For example Amy could return with some pretty awesome storylines 

• This maybe gives Donna a much better shot at a more deserving role in an administration. 

•Especially since both Donna and Amy served in Santos administration and just as Amy was Abbeys COS Donna was Helen’s. 

•**But lets get to what’s really the most important here....I personally feel Andy was obviously always pretty tight with Ed and Larry and for me there’s simply just no possibility for a reboot without Ed and Larry!** 

6.She is probably the only possibility that really serves to legitimize Toby’s return well! 

*I’m just saying Congress Woman Wyatt really makes so much sense here and imo the most important reason for that is because so far she would serve as clearly the easiest way for Aaron Sorkin to overcome the major Toby problem which would absolutely be a gigantic obstacle for him.*

*Richard Schiffs Toby is one of Sorkin’s personal all time favorite characters he has ever written.  He says this a lot. Wyatt for president really does almost instantly overcome that objection and at the very least provides Sorkin opportunities that since S7 are very necessary for him to continue to write Toby Ziegler.*

*If anyone was actually going to get Toby back in the WH Wyatt for president is seemingly the only feasible way I can see that *somewhat believably* happening. Not to mention the much needed “friction” and “conflict” that would create for Sorkin to use in his typically dialogue heavy screenplays.*

*I can also see Wyatt not only bringing Toby back via the WH residence (which is of course the simplest way to do it, either Andy and Toby married or through the Twins personally either way works for me I love Toby too!) but imo it could even make the argument an easier one if it happens to be made by Wyatt, if anyone can make the argument to the public and the audience that Toby serve’s as a trusted advisor to any president again it’s gotta be Andy. Right?*

7.On top of all of that even the flashback-Cameo method could possibly be used a little easier with Andy Wyatt as President, but I really don’t think that’s necessary if they made this choice.  

imo the more I think about this it almost serves (maybe a little to perfectly) all of Sorkins needs to revisit the series. 

I can’t lie though I personally actually really want to see Sam Sea*Born for president* or Charlie Young as president. I just think Andy is the much more feasible option here.

1558,"A Conversation About Sorkin So I wanted to get some other folks opinion regarding my opinion of Aaron Sorkin.  First off, I'm a huge fan of almost everything he has done.  My IPad is littered with his movies, his TV shows, etc.  I probably have watched more of his stuff than any other screenwriter out there.  There is something that does bother me with his writing though.

I've been watching a lot of his movies lately.  Molly's Game, The Social Network, Moneyball and Jobs specifically.  All of these are movies I really like but there is one issue I have with them and it is the artistic license he seems to take with real people, ones that are also still alive.  My examples are below (and maybe I'm wrong about a few so please correct me where I am wrong):

- Moneyball:  That movie made Art Howe look really bad and he was not that against the Moneyball approach according to him.  Art has had to defend himself in print about this which I think is incredibly unfair.  Make Reese from The Newsroom look bad, fine.  Make a real person look bad when they weren't, I have an issue with that.Also, it's not as if the A's didn't already still have all-star pitching.  

- Molly's Game:  I'm totally fine with the Idris Elba being the ""eyes of the audience"" and not being real.  However, from what I understand is that Molly's main accident didn't occur the way it was depicted in the film.  The main motivation of her going to LA is based upon a false presence, which is fine in a made up story but it's hard to keep with that in a ""based on a true story"".    Also, the conversation with the father (I love Coestner in this film) never happened.  

- Jobs:  Again, my understanding is that all of the fights/arguments before the presentations never happened and the feelings of Steve W and others were misrepresented.  

Again, I'm a huge fan of Sorkin but it's these items just seem like plot devices and are not true to the story.

Anyway else agree or am I nuts?",1, a conversation about sorkin so i wanted to get some other folk opinion regarding my opinion of aaron sorkin first off i m a huge fan of almost everything he ha done my ipad is littered with his movie his tv show etc i probably have watched more of his stuff than any other screenwriter out there there is something that doe bother me with his writing though i ve been watching a lot of his movie lately molly s game the social network moneyball and job specifically all of these are movie i really like but there is one issue i have with them and it is the artistic license he seems to take with real people one that are also still alive my example are below and maybe i m wrong about a few so please correct me where i am wrong moneyball that movie made art howe look really bad and he wa not that against the moneyball approach according to him art ha had to defend himself in print about this which i think is incredibly unfair make reese from the newsroom look bad fine make a real person look bad when they weren t i have an issue with that also it s not a if the a s didn t already still have all star pitching molly s game i m totally fine with the idris elba being the eye of the audience and not being real however from what i understand is that molly s main accident didn t occur the way it wa depicted in the film the main motivation of her going to la is based upon a false presence which is fine in a made up story but it s hard to keep with that in a based on a true story also the conversation with the father i love coestner in this film never happened job again my understanding is that all of the fight argument before the presentation never happened and the feeling of steve w and others were misrepresented again i m a huge fan of sorkin but it s these item just seem like plot device and are not true to the story anyway else agree or am i nut, a convers about sorkin so i want to get some other folk opinion regard my opinion of aaron sorkin first off i m a huge fan of almost everyth he ha done my ipad is litter with hi movi hi tv show etc i probabl have watch more of hi stuff than ani other screenwrit out there there is someth that doe bother me with hi write though i ve been watch a lot of hi movi late molli s game the social network moneybal and job specif all of these are movi i realli like but there is one issu i have with them and it is the artist licens he seem to take with real peopl one that are also still aliv my exampl are below and mayb i m wrong about a few so pleas correct me where i am wrong moneybal that movi made art howe look realli bad and he wa not that against the moneybal approach accord to him art ha had to defend himself in print about thi which i think is incred unfair make rees from the newsroom look bad fine make a real person look bad when they weren t i have an issu with that also it s not as if the a s didn t alreadi still have all star pitch molli s game i m total fine with the idri elba be the eye of the audienc and not be real howev from what i understand is that molli s main accid didn t occur the way it wa depict in the film the main motiv of her go to la is base upon a fals presenc which is fine in a made up stori but it s hard to keep with that in a base on a true stori also the convers with the father i love coestner in thi film never happen job again my understand is that all of the fight argument befor the present never happen and the feel of steve w and other were misrepres again i m a huge fan of sorkin but it s these item just seem like plot devic and are not true to the stori anyway els agre or am i nut

1565,"Eppur Si Muove - a failure to follow up? The recent discussion of the Bartlet sisters had me thinking about ""Eppur Si Muove"", and the writers failing to follow up on it.  In a sense, I recognize they \*had\* to ignore the ramifications in order to generate the drama of the next year, but these lines: 

WILL You're going to need to tell the President, sir.  

RUSSELL Am I?  

WILL It's going to come out, sir. The list is all over town.  

RUSSELL Well, maybe that's not so bad. It wasn't my plan, but it might be a happy accident. Just the thing we need to put a little distance between us and them. I wouldn't worry about.

1572,"West Wing Spinoff Ideas I was bored and I thought of a bunch of West Wing spinoff ideas.  Would you watch any of them?

&amp;#x200B;

**Keyworth**

Follows the psychiatric practice of Dr. Stanley Keyworth.  Each episode would be a session with a client.  If you've ever seen ""In Treatment"" with Gabriel Byrne, something like that.

**Tribbey &amp; Babbish**

Lionel Tribbey and Oliver Babbish, two former WH counsels, have started a law firm together in their post-political days.  They are the managing partners, and they have brought in Charlie Young(now a lawyer), and a stable of WW recurring characters - Ainsley Hayes, Cliff Calley, Joe Quincy, and Laurie(Sam's friend who was in law school) - for the firm.  Yeah, it's an unrealistic premise, but I have no doubt it would be good with all those characters as regulars.  Basically a lawyer show, but with potential to be more.

**Political Science 101**

Over a decade after he left the WH in scandal, this would follow Toby Ziegler as a professor of Political Science at Columbia.  Andy(still his ex-wife) and his now-college-age children Molly and Tuck would make regular appearances.  I guess his father Jules could also make an appearance or two, but Jerry Adler is 90 now, so I don't know.

We would see Toby lecturing his classes(plenty of opportunity for those great Toby monologues), dealing with students one-on-one, as a father, etc.  This would be a sort of quiet character piece about Toby.  Maybe a guest appearance now and then from former WWers, but for the most part, it would be just Toby.

**Red Lights**

Follows Josh and Donna as, post-Santos administration, they start a political consultancy firm, as full partners, and as husband and wife.

**Dr. Bartlet**

A hospital show with Dr. Eleanor ""Ellie"" Bartlet as the main character.

&amp;#x200B;

(A pair of prequels here, which would obviously need recasting for key roles)

**The Young Jed Bartlet**

This would follow Bartlet's years at Notre Dame.  Think of the flashbacks in ""Two Cathedrals"", except he's in college now.  That aesthetic.  We'd see him meet and begin a courtship with young Abbey, we'd see him studying economics and ditching his plans to be a priest, we'd find a way for young Mrs. Landingham to be there, maybe some appearances from Jed's dad.  Just the formative years of the future president.

**Hampshire**

This would follow Bartlet's years as governor of New Hampshire.  Aside from following all the political goings-on in New Hampshire(maybe there could be some run-ins with President Lassiter), we'd also see him develop his friendship with Leo(maybe we'd also see Leo as Secretary of Labor), we'd see him get diagnosed with MS, we'd see his daughters when they were younger, etc.  The final scene of the final episode would be the flashback from ""Bartlet For America"", where Leo comes to Bartlet's house and asks him to run for President.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Supremes**

This one's hardly original, but a show focusing on the SCOTUS with Evelyn Baker Lang, Christopher Mulready, and seven other fictional justices.

**Mandyville(Half joking here, but...)**

In which we find Mandy Hampton waking up from a coma she's been in for twenty years after having been shot in ""What Kind Of Day Has It Been?"".  At first we watch her re-orient herself to the world after having missed two decades, and then, after a while, pissed off, go looking for Josh and CJ to find out why nobody seemed to care or even

1578,"Who’s your Mrs Morello? In the season 3 episode “Stirred”, Donna learns her favorite high school teacher, Mrs Morello, is retiring. She bugs Josh all episode, hoping to get a proclamation for Mrs Morello, with Josh repeatedly turning her down. Being the softy that he is, however, leads him to to write a memo to the President who later calls Mrs Morello. 

It’s one of the sweetest moments of the series and one of my favorites all around. https://youtu.be/InJ23OG7sn8

Donna tells Mrs Morello that it’s because of her that she is standing in the Oval Office. 

So I ask you all, who’s your Mrs Morello? Who got you to where you are and, if given the opportunity, would look to call and thank when they retire. 

Mine, too, was my high school English teacher. Because of him, my love for reading was rekindled; I am a better writer because of it; I pursued English lit in college and while I may work in insurance I still use that critical thinking and analysis. More importantly though he taught us to look at things from different angles, literally and figuratively, as he let four dorky kids film short movies for our final or reviewed The Crucible through a modern lens of discrimination. So, Mr Hashemian, if you’re reading this (and I like to believe you’re a fan of Sorkin), Thank You. I might not be standing in the Oval Office but you certainly helped me be successful in life.

1580,"Would the “Mandy” character have worked if she was portrayed by Janel Moloney? I started a rewatch of the series and I’m showing it to my mom for her first time. No matter how many times I’ve seen these episodes, I’m still shocked to see Mandy in the Pilot. Then today I had this random shower thought: Janel Moloney’s natural chemistry with Bradley Whitford overpowered what ever was supposed to happen between Josh and Mandy, and essentially replaced Moira Kelly.

Not trying to shit on Moira Kelly, she’s a fine actress, but some people cannot speak Sorkin’s words the they’re meant to be said (pretentious, I know, but Exhibit A: The Newsroom). Mandy was supposed to be Josh’s “end-game” love interest but Janel and Brad just *worked* together, creating the inevitability of Josh and Donna’s romantic relationship. Then I got to thinking, if Mandy was played by Janel, would she have lasted and been more likable?

Janel naturally fit into Sorkin’s world and was able to land herself a permanent spot on the show, but Moira went through just the opposite. Unfortunately, Moira made Mandy an unbearable character. Janel is obviously capable of playing someone with a strong personality like Mandy’s (campaign/Santos Donna) and I imagined that if she played Mandy, Mandy could have been a character we love to hate. Janel and Brad’s ability to go back and forth, something he and Moira lacked, also would have brought a likability to Mandy. 

The show would be completely different if this happened. Even if Moira Kelly stayed on the show, what would Mandy even have done? She was always the “outsider” character and never really fit in with the rest of the staff.

Anyway, sorry if this is confusing and ramble-y but I’m curious to see what other people think of this. 

Edit: I’d imagine this scenario also including the Donna character, played by somebody else, and being more of the secondary/minor recurring character she was intended to be (like Ginger, Carol, etc.).",1, would the mandy character have worked if she wa portrayed by janel moloney i started a rewatch of the series and i m showing it to my mom for her first time no matter how many time i ve seen these episode i m still shocked to see mandy in the pilot then today i had this random shower thought janel moloney s natural chemistry with bradley whitford overpowered what ever wa supposed to happen between josh and mandy and essentially replaced moira kelly not trying to shit on moira kelly she s a fine actress but some people cannot speak sorkin s word the they re meant to be said pretentious i know but exhibit a the newsroom mandy wa supposed to be josh s end game love interest but janel and brad just worked together creating the inevitability of josh and donna s romantic relationship then i got to thinking if mandy wa played by janel would she have lasted and been more likable janel naturally fit into sorkin s world and wa able to land herself a permanent spot on the show but moira went through just the opposite unfortunately moira made mandy an unbearable character janel is obviously capable of playing someone with a strong personality like mandy s campaign santos donna and i imagined that if she played mandy mandy could have been a character we love to hate janel and brad s ability to go back and forth something he and moira lacked also would have brought a likability to mandy the show would be completely different if this happened even if moira kelly stayed on the show what would mandy even have done she wa always the outsider character and never really fit in with the rest of the staff anyway sorry if this is confusing and ramble y but i m curious to see what other people think of this edit i d imagine this scenario also including the donna character played by somebody else and being more of the secondary minor recurring character she wa intended to be like ginger carol etc, would the mandi charact have work if she wa portray by janel moloney i start a rewatch of the seri and i m show it to my mom for her first time no matter how mani time i ve seen these episod i m still shock to see mandi in the pilot then today i had thi random shower thought janel moloney s natur chemistri with bradley whitford overpow what ever wa suppos to happen between josh and mandi and essenti replac moira kelli not tri to shit on moira kelli she s a fine actress but some peopl cannot speak sorkin s word the they re meant to be said pretenti i know but exhibit a the newsroom mandi wa suppos to be josh s end game love interest but janel and brad just work togeth creat the inevit of josh and donna s romant relationship then i got to think if mandi wa play by janel would she have last and been more likabl janel natur fit into sorkin s world and wa abl to land herself a perman spot on the show but moira went through just the opposit unfortun moira made mandi an unbear charact janel is obvious capabl of play someon with a strong person like mandi s campaign santo donna and i imagin that if she play mandi mandi could have been a charact we love to hate janel and brad s abil to go back and forth someth he and moira lack also would have brought a likabl to mandi the show would be complet differ if thi happen even if moira kelli stay on the show what would mandi even have done she wa alway the outsid charact and never realli fit in with the rest of the staff anyway sorri if thi is confus and rambl y but i m curiou to see what other peopl think of thi edit i d imagin thi scenario also includ the donna charact play by somebodi els and be more of the secondari minor recur charact she wa intend to be like ginger carol etc

 •Angela Blake •Ryan Pierce •Rina •Roy Ashland •Greg Brock •Jeff Haffley  •General Alexander •Kate Harper just to name a few.  

I mean sure some were definitely necessary, specifically I can see •Ashland, •Haffley •General Alexander (*I guess? but I will always prefer Fitzwallace*) and maybe •Brock (*since he was pretty much the Danny Concannon replacement, although I don’t remember why Timothy Busfield couldn’t or didn’t appear in S5*) but the sheer total of MandyVille retirees that appear in S5 alone seems ridiculous and unnecessary to me. 

At a minimum I’d say •Angela Blake •Rina •Joe Quincy (*who by all accounts seems to be the actual intended S5 Token Mandy replacement introduced in late S4, but Im sure I could be wrong about this*) and •Ryan Pierce all seem to fit this bill.  

This season definitely introduced most of my all time least favorite characters. That Top spots currently a tie for me between •Angela Blake (*Since I will always stick by Josh Lyman and who I possibly irrationally resent because of the way she really made Leo come of as adversarial during this arc*) and •Kate Harper (*She just wasn’t needed! Nancy McNally still appeared in these seasons why introduce her at all? Plus as irrational as it may seem I do blame her directly and almost solely for causing Leo’s heart attack*). Although Mandy will still always maintain a top placement on that list. 

Did this swarm of needless and endless introduction of new characters in S5 bring anyone else’s least favorite along with it?

BARTLET:

little face.

SAM:

*[amazed]* I don't know how you... I don't know the word, I... don't know how you do it.

BARTLET:

You have a lot of help. You listen to everybody and then you call the play. *[rises to his feet]* **Sam. You're gonna run for President one day. Don't be scared. You can do it. I believe in you.**

I completely understand and also agree with those who will say that they think the California 47th campaign really hurts him or even that it completely disqualifies him here, but I’d counter that argument with the fact that by this point in the series timeline Sam Seaborn would’ve at the very least spent the last 8 years in the Santos administration as Josh Lyman’s Deputy COS in the WH.  Meaning he would have been a WH insider for over 12 years with plenty of campaign experience under his belt.  He also very likely could’ve taken another run at public office and won.  Just as Will Bailey did when he left the Bartlet WH and was elected to Congress in the Oregon 4th. 

I wonder more and more about this lately not only because of this dialogue from Hartsfield Landing, but also because the entire series was initially designed solely around Sam’s character as the main protagonist.  This is the most visible in the pilot for the series run, but he remained the protagonist for most if not all of the first season. 

I haven’t seen this concept or storyline mentioned at all in the many articles confirming Aaron Sorkin is “In talks of a West Wing reboot” 

I enjoy all of The West Wing characters and I agree there are numerous ways this new plot can develop, but am I really the only one wondering this? 

I’ve also wondered this same thing about Charlie Young’s character.  Although there was not any right on the nose dialogue to support this specific theory, I do feel there was definitely enough subtle foreshadowing throughout the series run to support this Character development.  Although I would agree that If Charlie married Zoey it could make this storyline somewhat less believable and at a minimum more difficult to explore and write.

1587,"Evidence of Things Not Seen Yet another mistake with regard to military decorations. At around 16:13 there's a shot of Will Bailey in his Air Force uniform, and his ribbons are pinned on upside down. My love for this series knows no bounds, but as a veteran of the United States Air Force, these mistakes really annoy me.

There are several of these issues throughout the show, all of them having to do with military medals and ribbons either being pinned on the wrong way or being misrepresented by the writers. I really wish the producers would have paid closer attention to these important (however minuscule) details. It just makes me feel like they said, ""Okay, let's just slap some ribbons on the costume. It doesn't really matter if they're on correctly. We don't have time to worry about that."" This isn't a parody. The actors are wearing exact replicas of uniforms worn by members of our armed forces, and they should be represented correctly.

1605,"I ran like Leo (long rant) One of my closest friends was in a freak accident yesterday. He was driving along with his father and out of nowhere a metal rod fell loose from a truck, pierced the windshield and lodged itself in his skull, going completely through it.
Somehow he survived, but he's in a deep coma, and after a delicate three hour extraction from the car wreck they have been operating on him for nine hours straight.
I was a groomsman at his wedding, and his wife, also one of my closest friends, was my godmother (I was only baptized at 27, having grown up in a non-religious left-wing family).
As soon as I heard about the accident I ran out of the government office I work in (I'm a political operative, and everyone was very caring and understanding, thankfully), and got in an uber bound for the hospital.
They're only thirty-one years old like myself, and just got a beautiful baby boy eight months ago to join their lovely one-and-a-half year old blond girl. The kids are at home with their grandmother, and once I got to the hospital and did my clumsy best at comforting her, I tried to get through to some of my medical connections to see if we could get some unofficial information on his condition (doctors will often only inform relatives once they've got something conclusive).
He's in a deep coma and we don't know how long it'll take for him to come back, but thankfully it seems any brain damage was minor, in what can only be described as a miracle within a tragedy.
After a while hospital staff politely asked us non-relatives to leave, so we went outside and kept our vigil throughout the night.
Now it's three a.m. and we're freezing our asses off but everyone refuses to leave until we hear how the operation went. It's mighty cold here in Europe in peak winter, but thank God I brought my trusty winter coat, West-Wing style.
Finally some family members come down and tell us the operation went well, but it'll take some time for us to know the full results. Everyone is relieved, for as small as they might seem at this point, every good news count. Then they tell us he's in ICU, and that our friend's wife (my best friend and godmother) insisted on seeing him before going home to soothe her children, even in this mangled state.
We panic, for we know as strong and brave as she is, it'll be a sight that might break her. So we scramble to the various exits hoping to catch her as she leaves, and make sure she gets home safe.
I'm walking towards my assigned exit as one of our friends calls me saying she was spotted coming my way, and I start to pick-up speed, going from a fast walk to a full-on sprint, not in an instant (don't ask me why, I guess my brain wasn't fully there yet after all the tribulations of that day) but rather slowly, so I literally do the ""Leo run"" from the season 4 finale, stopping at last in front of the hospital door panting, just in time to hug my best friend and godmother on the hardest night of her life.

Also, English isn't my first language, so apologies for any spelling mistakes.

1607,"Favorite Season Two Episode? Season 1 is complete. The winner was In Excelsis Deo. Second place was Celestial Navigation. They actually tied but I gave the win to In Excelsis for most total votes.  In Third was Take This Sabbath Day. Fourth was Mr Willis Of Ohio; Fifth was Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.  The link is here for all the details (https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/aoo1m4/favorite_season_one_episodes/).

So now it is time for Season Two's favorite episodes.  Same rules as before, **please list your favorite episodes from Season Two only in order from 1 to 5**. (I loved reading the explanations for the choices as well so feel free to add those as well if you'd like.)

*EDIT 1:  I know we are going to have lots of votes for Two Cathedrals but don't forget the rest of the list too.  Those other votes make a big difference in the winner (or at least 2-5 place this season).*

*EDIT 2: I will post the final totals later today and start Season 3 then.*

*EDIT 3: So 'Two Cathedrals' did end up on top but the voting was much closer than I think we expected.  (I only ended up using ballots with at least 3 episodes).   6 episodes received no votes (including 'The Portland Trip' which I found surprising.  I really like that one.)*

*'Two Cathedrals' ended up in first with 65 points.*  Right behind in second was 'Noel' with 61.  It actually had more total votes but 'Cathedrals' had so many first place votes it ended up on top.  Third place was 'In The Shadow of Two Gunman' with 56.  Those three really did separate themselves.  Fourth was '17 People' at 37; Fifth was basically a three way tie between 'Galileo', 'The Stackhouse Filibuster' and 'Somebody's Going To Emergency…'.  The total votes are below.*

*Two Cathedrals (10,3,0,1,1) = 65; 
Noel (3,6,7,0,1) = 61; 
In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen (5,3,5,1,2) = 56; 
17 People (1,3,4,3,2) = 37; 
Galileo (1,2,1,1,4) = 22; 
The Stackhouse Filibuster (1,1,1,4,2) = 22; 
Somebody's Going To Emergency, Somebody's Going To Jail (1,1,2,2,2) = 21; 
Shibboleth (0,1,1,4,2) = 17; 
Ellie (1,0,1,0,3) = 11; 
Bad Moon Rising (0,1,0,2,0) = 8; 
And It's Surely To Their Credit (0,0,1,1,2) = 7; 
18th and Potomac (0,1,0,1,0) = 6; 
The Midterms (0,1,0,0,0) = 4; 
In This White House (0,0,1,0,0) = 3; 
Bartlet's Third State Of The Union (0,0,0,1,0) = 2*

1609,"Bartlet's Daughters I saw in comments of another post that there might not be much love for Ellie for some people, but for me, she was my favourite Bartlet sister. Even though she doesn't have a ton of appearances (just for reference, Liz has 6, Ellie has 9, and Zoey has 25) she does have an arc and I think I find her the most believable out of the three characters. 

It's kinda hard to judge Liz as a character; I'd say 4 of her 6 appearances (7A, Dogs of War, Abu el Banat, and Requiem) were little more than cameos. The only storyline she had was in season 6 when her ass of a husband was running for Congress and when he was having an affair (both minor plots). I mean she clearly wanted to stay out of the spotlight and was both mature and smart enough to do so. Sure she had a questionable choice for a husband but she made her father's life easier by not adding to his troubles. 

As for Zoey, I did like her, don't get me wrong, but I found the whole hanging out with questionable characters (Jean-Paul) and not taking her secret service protection seriously in season 4 (even though her father had been shot 4 years prior), was kinda cliche. We don't see much character  development, even though she appears in 25 episodes (sure she was far from a  main character so I wouldn't have expected a ton of development but we see more development in Ellie in much fewer appearances).

Maybe it's the middle child in me, but I always found myself identifying more with Ellie. She did not want anything to do with her father's career choice and does a good job at staying out of it, except when she wants to stand up for someone she supports (when she spoke out in support of the Surgeon General). In Ellie we see her very distant to her father, yet in the last season we see her willing to have a White House wedding when she very easily could have eloped or done something quieter.",1, bartlet s daughter i saw in comment of another post that there might not be much love for ellie for some people but for me she wa my favourite bartlet sister even though she doesn t have a ton of appearance just for reference liz ha 6 ellie ha 9 and zoey ha 25 she doe have an arc and i think i find her the most believable out of the three character it s kinda hard to judge liz a a character i d say 4 of her 6 appearance 7a dog of war abu el banat and requiem were little more than cameo the only storyline she had wa in season 6 when her as of a husband wa running for congress and when he wa having an affair both minor plot i mean she clearly wanted to stay out of the spotlight and wa both mature and smart enough to do so sure she had a questionable choice for a husband but she made her father s life easier by not adding to his trouble a for zoey i did like her don t get me wrong but i found the whole hanging out with questionable character jean paul and not taking her secret service protection seriously in season 4 even though her father had been shot 4 year prior wa kinda cliche we don t see much character development even though she appears in 25 episode sure she wa far from a main character so i wouldn t have expected a ton of development but we see more development in ellie in much fewer appearance maybe it s the middle child in me but i always found myself identifying more with ellie she did not want anything to do with her father s career choice and doe a good job at staying out of it except when she want to stand up for someone she support when she spoke out in support of the surgeon general in ellie we see her very distant to her father yet in the last season we see her willing to have a white house wedding when she very easily could have eloped or done something quieter, bartlet s daughter i saw in comment of anoth post that there might not be much love for elli for some peopl but for me she wa my favourit bartlet sister even though she doesn t have a ton of appear just for refer liz ha 6 elli ha 9 and zoey ha 25 she doe have an arc and i think i find her the most believ out of the three charact it s kinda hard to judg liz as a charact i d say 4 of her 6 appear 7a dog of war abu el banat and requiem were littl more than cameo the onli storylin she had wa in season 6 when her ass of a husband wa run for congress and when he wa have an affair both minor plot i mean she clearli want to stay out of the spotlight and wa both matur and smart enough to do so sure she had a question choic for a husband but she made her father s life easier by not ad to hi troubl as for zoey i did like her don t get me wrong but i found the whole hang out with question charact jean paul and not take her secret servic protect serious in season 4 even though her father had been shot 4 year prior wa kinda clich we don t see much charact develop even though she appear in 25 episod sure she wa far from a main charact so i wouldn t have expect a ton of develop but we see more develop in elli in much fewer appear mayb it s the middl child in me but i alway found myself identifi more with elli she did not want anyth to do with her father s career choic and doe a good job at stay out of it except when she want to stand up for someon she support when she spoke out in support of the surgeon gener in elli we see her veri distant to her father yet in the last season we see her will to have a white hous wed when she veri easili could have elop or done someth quieter

1620,"Favorite Season One Episodes? I have done this for other shows and got great responses so I thought I would try it here.  Have we done a ranking of our favorite episodes by season recently?  If not, I would like to start one.

Specifically, I am asking you to rank your **FIVE favorite episodes from  Season 1 ranked from 1-5**.  I can then provide a list of the votes (5 points for 1st, 4 for 2nd, etc) and we can see what the consensus is.

Feel free to add a paragraph or sentence (or nothing) about why you love the episode.  I have definitely seen other people get turned on to different episodes because someone has a great perspective and shares it.

*EDIT 1:*  I am loving the responses so far so my plan will be to keep the votes going through the weekend and then starting Season 2's list on Monday or Tuesday and post the final results for S1.  Lots of of the expected favorites but you can already see some different choices showing up.  Can anything beat the front-runners of 'Take this Sabbath Day' or 'Celestial Navagation' or 'In Excelsis Deo'?  We will see…

*EDIT 2:*  So I haven't gotten anything new lately so I will post the totals.  Only four episodes did not receive a single vote - *Post Hoc, Ergo Proctor Hoc*, *20 Hours in LA*, *The White House Pro-Am*, *Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics*.

It was a two horse race for first place, ***In Excelsis Deo*** tied with ***Celestial Navigation*** with 30 points.  *In Excelsis* had more total votes, *Celestial* more first place votes.  Third Place was ***Take This Sabbath Day***. After that was a decent gap and then a bunching of episodes with ***Mr Willis Of Ohio*** and ***Let Bartlet Be Bartlet*** leading that group.

But the emphasis on Donna over all the other assistants has always seemed a bit out of place for me. She is often present or involved in things that none of the other assistants are. 

An example...when they gather at the inaugural ball for the president to make Will Bailey officially part of the staff, she is the only one there (besides Charlie who is there actually helping the president) that is not senior staff. Where's Ginger? She's the communication assistant.

Another one off the top of my head...when senior staff meets for breakfast... Margaret is there with Leo, which makes perfect sense to me as he's COS. But the only other assistant present is Donna. Where's Carol? Where's Ginger?

1633,"Process Stories/Inauguration: Part 1 - Jack Reese's Military Decorations [SPOILER] for anyone not past S04E07

In keeping with the theme from my post on Adm. Fitzwallace's medals, there are yet more errors in conjunction with the use of military decorations that should be pointed out, but these are far more obvious. Jumping ahead to ""Inauguration: Part 1"", during the scene when Donna lets Josh know that the tickets for the balls came, she shows off her knowledge (or lack thereof) about Jack's dress blues and lists his decorations. The line is, ""Warfare pin, submarine officer pin, two commendation medals, meritorious unit, purple heart, bronze cross and a saber.""

We'll begin with the fact that amongst the long list of U.S. military decorations, there is no such thing as a ""bronze cross"". There is the bronze star and the purple heart, neither of which Jack possesses. Going back to ""Process Stories"", we can clearly see Jack's ribbon rack and his insignias. They are as follows - Navy achievement (not commendation) medal (x1) with a ""V"" for valor, meritorious unit commendation (x1), Navy ""E"" ribbon (x1), Navy &amp; Marine Corps overseas service ribbon (x1), submarine officer warfare insignia and his Joint Chiefs of Staff identification badge, which is worn by staff and support personnel assigned to the Office of the Chairman and the Joint Staff. The only one she was correct about was his meritorious unit commendation, because when she said ""warfare pin, submarine officer pin"", the line was clearly written to indicate two separate pins. There is only one pin for submarine officer and enlisted personnel, and that is the submarine warfare insignia, or ""fish"", that is awarded after extensive training on all the boat's systems. Gold denotes officer, silver denotes enlisted. The others Donna speaks of (besides the non-existent bronze cross) are clearly not on his rack.

By the way, for the sake of anyone who might think I'm attempting to trash the show, please be aware that I'm in the camp of those who think this is the greatest TV show ever produced. Speaking ill of our beloved TWW is not my intent. But I'm also a veteran of the U.S. Air Force and a stickler for continuity, and have always been disappointed with the surprising lack of attention the producers sometimes paid to matters of military uniform continuity. Perhaps they thought the show would never be watched again after the first airing and that no one would catch these little details. But when they wrote Donna's line, which I quoted at the top of the post, all they needed to do was go back and quickly look at the two or three seconds of the scene in Jack's office and take note of the decorations they adorned his uniform with. Taking the time to do a little due diligence wouldn't have cost them anything. And before anyone brings it up, I already checked his oval office scene in Arctic Radar, and no change was made to his decorations between the two episodes.

1639,"Ranking Characters: The Regulars So, over a year ago I started this project of ranking characters.  In late 2017 I posted the one-offs, sometime in Spring 2018 I posted the 2-4 recurring episode thread, then late last summer I posted the 5-10 episode recurring and 11+ episode recurring threads in close proximity to each other.  All of those lists garnered positive reception(though the most recent 11+ episode recurring one garnered some rather heated disagreement over my placement of Ainsley Hayes(she was #10 overall, not that low!) and even Bob Russell).

If don't remember or weren't around when those threads were posted, here are the links to the previous posts, to refresh your memory - maybe have a look:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/92q7xb/ranking\_characters\_11\_episode\_recurring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/92q7xb/ranking_characters_11_episode_recurring/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/915jha/ranking\_characters\_510\_episode\_recurring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/915jha/ranking_characters_510_episode_recurring/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/8eznao/ranking\_characters\_24\_episode\_recurring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/8eznao/ranking_characters_24_episode_recurring/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/6ydxfk/ranking\_characters\_the\_oneoffs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/6ydxfk/ranking_characters_the_oneoffs/)

Anyway, I got sidetracked with other things so it's been a while, but today I'm posting the final installment of the project.  This has taken me a while to write.  I mean, it's a hell of a lot of writing, so I hope someone actually takes the time to read it all.  Most probably won't.  Oh well.

I'm actually posting two lists here.  The first will be a brief list ranking and acknowledging some of what we'll call the non-credited regulars - characters who are seen on a regular basis but are never seen in the credits - these are mostly assistants, but there are a couple of others as well.

The second list will be the main one, the fifteen characters who have appeared in the opening credits, with much more writing than the first list.

Without further ado...

# Non-Credited Regulars

**8. Cathy / Portrayed by Suzy Nakamura**

**Appeared in 9 episodes, Season 1**

Cathy was an additional assistant that Sam had for nine episodes in the first season, after which she went to Mandyville.  She is often forgotten in conversations like this.  Not much say to really.

**7. Nancy / Portrayed by Renee Estevez**

**Appeared in 44 episodes, seasons 1-7**

Played by Martin Sheen's daughter, Nancy was a direct assistant to the President, seen every now and then coming in and out of whatever room he's in to tell him that so-and-so is here or such-and-such wants to speak to him, among other things.

**6. White House Press Corp reporters Katie Witt, Mark O'Donnell, Steve, and Chris / Portrayed by Kris Murphy, Timothy Davis-Reed, Charles Noland, and Mindy Seeger**

**Katie Witt appeared in 53 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

**Mark O'Donnell appeared in 43 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

**Steve appeared in 52 episodes, Seasons 2-7**

**Chris appeared in 34 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

Ok, so these are the four - and I think they're the only ones - press corp reporters that appear regularly with dialogue.  I felt it was important to acknowledge them because having some familiar faces in the press room throughout adds continuity and makes the show feel more realistic in those scenes.  I've included the four of them together instead of individually because none of them has enough screen time to have gotten to know any of them, but together they should be acknowledged.  If you don't know who they are by name, here are some photos to jog your memory(Steve and Chris don't have last names because they don't have last names on iMDB):

**5. Bonnie / Portrayed by Devika Parikh**

**Appeared in 41 episodes, Seasons 1-5**

One of two long-term assistants in the communications office who served Toby and Sam(and later Will).  Always being given many order, always dependable.  Disappeared for some reason in the post-Sorkin years.

**4. Ed &amp; Larry / Portrayed by Peter James Smith and William Duffy**

**Appeared in 47/48 episodes, respectively, Seasons 1-7**

I feel like Ed &amp; Larry existed because while Toby had people who reported directly to him(Sam, C.J., Will), Josh never did, outside of Donna.  They were there to make it look like there were other people working under Josh.

So they're often seen in meetings about legislative-type things, they seem competent enough, and they're funny too from time to time.

**3. Ginger / Portrayed by Kim Webster**

**Appeared in 58 Episodes, Seasons 1-7**

The other long-term assistant in the communications office.  I've always felt that Kim Webster really gave Ginger a good deal of personality in her relatively limited screen time.  She always seemed feisty, unintimidated, not afraid to give Toby some lip from time to time.  I always liked her.

**2. Carol Fitzpatrick / Portrayed by Melissa Fitzgerald**

**Appeared in 102 Episodes, Seasons 1-7**

C.J.'s right-hand in the press office(still seen but less so after C.J. becomes chief of staff), she was always such a positive person, happy to be there, and uber-competent at her job as well.  Always liked that her and C.J. seemed to have a genuine friendship.  Seems like everybody likes Carol.

**1. Margaret Hooper / Portrayed by NiCole Robinson**

**Appeared in 106 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

The obvious #1 here.  The executive assistant to the chief of staff under both Leo and C.J., Margaret was a wonderfully kooky, offbeat character(NiCole Robinson deserves all the credit in the world for bringing her to life).  Her eccentric demeanor can sometimes mask the fact that she is as good as anybody could be at her job, that Leo and C.J. would be lost without her, and that she cares deeply about her bosses and her job.  I think C.J. got right to the point with this bit of dialogue:

&gt;You're an odd woman.  I've never understood you.  But you're extremely capable.  You run this office like a watch.  You're tall, which is reassuring.  Leo may need you, and if he does, that's okay.  But if he's willing to part with you, I hope you'll stay.

Margaret is as memorable is any other character.

And now the final list...

# The Regulars

And we reach the final list of the project.

As an aside, it's never easy to put characters in an order like this, much less the *main* characters.  Some decisions were easier than others.  The top seven in particular was murderously difficult to put in order, aside from the top two which were a given to me at the outset.  All of these characters are so great, it hurts to put anyone lower than they might have been.  But I figure there's no order I can put them in that won't piss somebody off, so I may as well just put them in the order I feel is right, which after much deliberation and mind-changing, is exactly what I have done.  Without further ado...

**15. Mandy Hampton / Portrayed by Moira Kelly**

**Appeared In: 20 Episodes(+2 credit-only), Season 1**

**Title: White House Media Consultant, Season 1**

As if it was going to be anybody else at #15.  Moira Kelly is a great actress, I don't think anyone has ever blamed her, but the character just was not likable.  She didn't fit in.  The show was an idealistic, aspirational view of government, and in the Sorkin years(it was different post-Sorkin), the conflict was always between Bartlet's staff and whoever was opposing them.  It was them against the world.  That dynamic was essential to what made the show what it was.  Having someone inside the team constantly arguing with and antagonizing other members of the team didn't work.

Additionally, she just came across as a shallow person.  She seemed to always care more about how something looked or how something would play than about what the administration was actually doing.  Yes, her job was as a media consultant, but C.J.'s job dealt with the media as well and she always cared 100% as much about the real stuff as she did about how it played, hell, she probably cared MORE about the real stuff.

The character just didn't work well.  Although I've never been a fan of characters just disappearing without explanation.

**14. Kate Harper / Portrayed by Mary McCormack**

**Appeared In: 30 Episodes(+18 credit-only), Seasons 5-7**

**Title: Deputy National Security Advisor, Seasons 5-7**

IIRC, Kate was not a very popular character at the time, when the Post-Sorkin seasons were first airing, but has maybe grown a little in popularity over the years.

There are several issues with Kate, IMO.

One is that, like Mandy, she is more of a pragmatist in a world populated with idealists.  Bartlet's staff were all, to varying degrees, passionate and partisan, and would breathe fire to defend their convictions.  In contrast, Kate was not a politician or a political operative, having come from a military/defense background, and would often come off as colder and more dispassionate.  I just felt like it didn't jive a lot of the time.

Another is that she essentially ended up replacing the far superior character of Nancy McNally.  Nancy appears in 20 episodes total, and ""Talking Points"", in which she introduces Kate to Bartlet(and us) near the end of season 5, is the 17th.  She only appeared in three more episodes in the following two seasons.  Any time Nancy would've ordinarily been there, Kate is there instead.  If that was the intent, I can't support it.

To me, after many re-watches, it just seems to me that Wells and his team knew ahead of time that Josh was going to leave the WH in season 6, that Leo was going to be in a reduced role, that Will was going to be on the campaign trail a lot, and that with basically only Bartlet, C.J., and Toby left, they simply needed another character to be in the WH as a regular.  With a few exceptions(the middle east peace summit at the beginning of season 6), her plots were usually filler and not all that important.

**13. Annabeth Schott / Portrayed by Kristin Chenoweth**

**Appeared In: 23 Epsiodes(+11 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: Deputy Press Secretary, Season 6**

**Aide to Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate Leo McGarry, Season 7**

Annabeth would've been higher on this list if she'd appeared in more episodes.  Kristen Chenoweth has a magnetic personality, and she succeeds in the delicate balancing act of making the character so relentlessly upbeat and bright and positive without being annoying.  It's impossible not to like her.

Yet, despite the happy nature of the character, her most memorable and effective scene is easily in the hospital in ""Election Day, Part 2"", when, her face drenched in tears, she informs Josh(and us) that Leo McGarry has passed on.  Chenoweth killed it in that scene.

I want to rank her higher, but as likable as she is, her role just wasn't substantial enough to put any higher.

**12. Will Bailey / Portrayed by Joshua Malina**

**Appeared In: 71 Episodes(+9 credit-only), Seasons 4-7**

**Title: White House Deputy Director Of Communications, Season 4**

**Chief Of Staff to the Vice-President Of The United States, Season 5**

**Campaign Manager, Russell Campaign, Season 6**

**White House Director Of Communications, Season 7**

Will is perhaps the most frustrating character on this list, and I struggled with where to place him.  The Will of season 4 is a genuinely likable guy, a little aloof, a little in over his head, but a good guy, super intelligent, hard worker, awed by where he finds himself, working in the White House.

But his character was essentially sacrificed in season 5 - the awed, aloof guy who believed in certain principles enough to get a dead guy elected, who excelled at speechwriting, turned into an ambition-driven operative in order to set him up as Russell's campaign manager and Josh's foil in the season 6 primaries.   And then in season 7, he's almost an afterthought, his most memorable moments being his ascension to the title of White House Director Of Communications after Toby's firing, and his much-maligned romance with Kate(it was a decent idea on paper, but they had no chemistry).

Malina is a good actor - anything that went wrong with the character was not his fault at all - and when I see Will in his good moments, it frustrates me because of what he could've been, but his bad moments, when he's reduced to acting so punk-ish to Josh and so forth because the plot calls for it, are enough to drag him down this low.

**11. Matthew ""Matt"" Santos / Portrayed by Jimmy Smits**

**Appeared In: 35 Episodes(+2 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: United States Congressman From Texas, Season 6**

**Democratic Nominee for President Of The United States/President-Elect Of The United States, Season 7**

I think both of the season 6-7 candidate characters were well-written and well-performed, and had either of them existed for longer than 1.5 seasons, they'd probably rank higher on the list, but they were only around for a small slice of the show, so I can't see ranking either any higher than this - though they were always going to be at the top of 10-15 range, as they are pretty easily the best-written and best-performed and most important of those characters.

I put Santos one rung lower than Vinick, and the reason will be clear in the Vinick write-up.  For right now, I'll just say what I like about Santos.

The character was conceived shortly after Obama's 2004 convention speech.  He was based on Obama and, some might say, in turn had some influence on the 2008 election in which Obama was elected in real life.  The character was supposed to have many of the same characteristics as the real Obama - young, charismatic, unabashedly liberal, etc.

Santos displayed two traits throughout the campaign - integrity and insecurity.  Integrity in that he didn't want to do an attack ad in ""Freedonia"", in that he didn't initially want to make a photo-op out of his service as a military reserve, integrity in turning Russell's VP offer down, integrity in not bowing out at the convention because ""it's not my place to decide who the nominee should be.  That decision is yours and yours alone"".  Also, if you believe the story he told Vinick(and I see no reason not to), he displayed integrity in stepping up to support his irresponsible brother's child because it was the right thing to do.

He was insecure about his ability to play the game of presidential politics, especially at the beginning - there were a number of occasions in which Josh would have to teach Santos how to play the game, and Santos would express frustration at having to do what in his view were such trivial things instead of talking about real issues that mattered.

I appreciated his willingness and determination to hold onto his integrity in the face of losing, of not being comfortable with the game of presidential politics until he could figure out how to play it on his own terms.

In terms of policy, he was an ideal liberal, and nowhere was that more front-and-center than in the debate episode, in which he advocated for medicare-for-all, green energy, public education, and more, and put a bow on it with his defense of the liberal label:

&gt;Yes, a liberal Republican, Senator. What happened to them? They got run out of your party. What did liberals do that was so offensive to the liberal party? I'll tell you what they did. Liberals got women the right to vote. Liberals got African-Americans the right to vote. Liberals created Social Security and lifted millions of elderly people out of poverty. Liberals ended segregation. Liberals passed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act. Liberals created Medicare. Liberals passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. What did Conservatives do? They opposed them on every one of those things,   every one. So when you try to hurl that label at my feet, 'Liberal,' as if it were something to be ashamed of, something dirty, something to run away from, it won't work, Senator, because I will pick up that label and I will wear it as a badge of honor.

Matt Santos was a great, charismatic character, a beacon of liberalism, and shares many qualities with Obama, whom I consider to be the one of the greatest presidents we've had.  So why is he above Vinick?  Read on.

**10. Arnold Vinick / Portrayed by Alan Alda**

**Appeared In: 18 Episodes(+10 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: United States Senator From California, Season 6**

**Republican Nominee for President Of The United States/Secretary Of State-Designate, Season 7**

So why Vinick above Santos?  Because Vinick is a Republican whose politics I vehemently disagree with and who I would never vote for against any decently capable Democrat, but who I still like a great deal, and I know many share that opinion.  To create such a character on a show dominated by very vocal liberals and Democrats, whose audience is mostly very liberal, is, from both a writing and acting standpoint, simply a heavier lift than to create a character like Santos.  It's that simple.

From a writing standpoint, to create a moderate Republican, a liberal Republican, a pro-choice Republican from California, was a great contrast to the rightward lurch the party was experiencing and continues to experience in real life.  To use the platform to show what a Republican used to be and what it still could be was ingenious.

From an acting standpoint, they hit a home run with Alda.  I mean, Jimmy Smits is a very good actor.  He is.  But Alda is a legendary actor, a national treasure.  He played the character note-perfectly, made him a three-dimensional, complicated, genuine, well-intentioned, downright warm, person.  I really don't think the character would've worked nearly as well as it did or been liked as much as he was in the hands of a lesser actor.  Alda is probably the #1 reason I'm ranking Vinick this high.

I'd also mention that, like Santos, Vinick was also a man of great integrity.  When Bruno found Santos's briefcase and gave it to Vinick, a lot of candidates would've ran with it, but what did Vinick do?  He set up a meeting with Santos, gave him a chance to explain himself, took him at his word, and didn't use it.  In ""The Al Smith Dinner"", he ultimately chose to denounce the ad attacking Santos's pro-choice position even though it would've scored him points with the right wing, because it would've been disingenuous on his part not to.  In ""In God We Trust"", he declined to go to church because it would've been phony:

&gt;Look, I respect Reverend Butler.  And I respect his church too much to use it for my own political purposes.  And That's exactly what I'd be doing if I went down there this Sunday.  Because the truth is, it would just be an act of political phoniness.  I may be wrong but I suspect our churches already have enough political phonies in them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Senator, do you or do you not--?  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't see how we can have a separation of church and state in this government if you have to pass a religious test to get in this government.  And I wanna warn everyone in the press and all the voters out there.  If you demand expressions of religious faith from politicians, you are just begging to be lied to.  They won 't all lie to you, but a lot of them will, and it'll be the easiest lie they ever had to tell to get your votes.  So every day until the end of this campaign, I'll answer any question anyone has on government.  But if you have a question on religion, please, go to church.  Thank you.

Finally, in ""Election Day, Part 2"", after receiving news of Leo's death, Vinick's advisors tell him he should challenge a Santos win on grounds of tainted electors in the wake of Leo's passing.  Vinick refuses to use Leo's death that way:

&gt;How about creating a conscience for ourselves? I've known Leo for 20 years.  Can we please not use him as a step stool?

Aside from all of that, I thought both the writers and Alda did a great job of showing the humanity within the politician, particularly towards the end - when he got sick from shaking so many hands, and then after the election, in ""The Last Hurrah"", when we get to see go overnight from almost being president to being, relatively speaking, no one.

He was just a great, thought-provoking character, despite being politically the opposite of me and most of the show's audience.

*Here is a demarcation point.  I consider all of the characters ahead to be the 'core' cast.  They are 'the family'.  The characters 15-10 are not 'in the family', not even Will.  These are the characters who were there from beginning to end(even if it took Charlie a couple episodes to appear and even if Sam was gone for a few years).*

**9. Charlie Young / Portrayed by Dule Hill**

**Appeared in 131 Episodes(+6 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: Personal Aide to the President, Seasons 1-6**

**Deputy Special Assistant/Aide to the White House Chief Of Staff, Seasons 6-7**

Charlie was an improbable character - a college-age kid whose father wasn't in his life, whose mother was killed, who at such a young age was thrust into being the primary guardian over his younger sister, who then later on became the target of an act of terror.  You might think that such a person might be hardened, cynical, jaded, but Charlie somehow remains emotionally open.  The combination of that emotional maturity, uncommon intelligence, and general kind demeanor is what defines the character.

Watching this wounded kid take advantage of the opportunity of a lifetime, watching him grow up before our eyes, watching his relationship with Bartlet blossom as they become surrogate father-and-son, watching his on-and-off relationship the first-daughter Zoey, is a joy.

I enjoy his snarkiness from time to time as well.  In ""Shibboleth"" he and Mrs. Landingham have the following exchange about the knife:

&gt;MRS. LANDINGHAM: He's very particular.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE That's one word for it.

In ""Gone Quiet"", he and Bartlet have this conversation:

&gt;BARTLET: That makes sense. Also, there's a chance I could get hit getting on or off.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: \[laughs a little\] Yeah.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Excuse me?  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: Sir?  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: You think I'm not tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One?  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: I think Dikembe Mutombo isn't tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One.

And in Arctic Radar, after Bartlet screams at the UN Secretary-General about parking tickets, Charlie responds with perfect timing:

&gt;BARTLET: \[screaming\] There are big signs! You can't park there! They should get towed! I hope they get towed to Queens and the Triboro is closed and there's a big craft show at Shea, a flea market or a tractor show!  
&gt;  
&gt;He hangs up.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: Well, that was probably his secretary.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Damn it.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: You can bet she'll be parking it in a garage, though.

Charlie's awesome.

**8. Donnatella 'Donna' Moss / Portrayed by Janel Moloney**

**Appeared In 142 Episodes(+8 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: Senior Assistant to the White House Deputy Chief Of Staff, Seasons 1-6**

**Aide/Spokeswoman, Russell Campaign, Season 6**

**Spokeswoman, Santos Campaign, Season 7**

Who doesn't love Donna?

There's her kind, sweet disposition.  Excepting the times Josh annoys her past her breaking point, she always has a warmth about her.  She always has a bright and sunny outlook and always cares for others.  This is evident in the way she always takes care of Josh on a personal level(she's often the only one who can calm him down when he's worked up), how she was all worried in ""The Fall's Gonna Kill You"" about a satellite falling to Earth and potentially hurting people, how she wanted a proclamation for her teacher Mrs. Morello in ""Stirred"", and so on.

She's also highly intelligent, competent, and resourceful.  She is portrayed as kind of flaky sometimes, but I think that's a mirage.  Like in that flashback in ""In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen"" where Donna claims to have had five majors and two minors?  I actually take that to mean she has a degree of intellectual curiosity such that she can't decide which subject to stick with.  This is a person that didn't have the clear path that pretty much every other character on this list other than Charlie did - she didn't go to or graduate from elite schools, she had no big career plan, none of that.  To go from where she was, coming off the street with no degree or experience, to boldly start working for someone who never hired you, to scratch and claw and work so hard and get up where did, doing what she did, you can't do that if you're not a highly intelligent individual.  And over the years she became uber-competent at her job and invaluable to her superiors.

Her girl-next-door looks don't hurt either.

I think Donna had one of the best post-Sorkin arcs, and therefore one of the best overall arcs, of any character, in terms of growth.  While she was uber-competent at her job, over the years she began to feel like she was outgrowing being someone's assistant, like she wanted to do more.  This became an underlying source of tension, as I'm sure Josh at least subconsciously was afraid of losing her, in more ways than one, and thus dragged his feet in terms of giving her opportunity for growth - despite doing it in little ways like sending her to Gaza as part of the model.

So she left him and went out and grew as a person and as a professional before they finally re-connected during the general election, and she got to end her story becoming the chief-of-staff to the incoming first lady.  It's just a satisfying character arc for a good person who deserved good things - she started as a 20-something looking for her place in the world and ended up having found it and then some.

**7. Sam Seaborne / Portrayed by Rob Lowe**

**Appeared In: 80 Episodes(+5 credit-only)**

**Title: White House Deputy Director Of Communications, Seasons 1-4**

**White House Deputy Chief Of Staff-designate, Season 7**

The OG main character.

Sam was a different breed than than Josh and Toby.  Whereas the latter two(and even Leo) went straight into politics, Sam is the only one that actually practiced law.  Perhaps this is why he often seems more level-headed, even-keeled, emotionally adjusted than Josh and Toby, and why his style of argument might seem more disciplined, whereas Josh and Toby use a more impassioned, fiery mode of debate.

Because of all of this, Sam is perhaps more likely to to see the bigger picture in certain cases where Josh and Toby would be more likely to be focused on the trenches in the political fight of the moment.  They live for the political fight, they fight like their lives depend on it.  Sam can certainly get worked up when he wants to, but in general, he's more likely to be pragmatic, to compromise and fight another day.  He doesn't *need* politics the way they do(hence his decision to practice law instead multiple times).

I think they also differ in that Josh and Toby, to quote Bartlet, want to be the guy the guy depends on.  Sam sometimes behaves more like he wants to eventually be the guy.  Maybe that's why Bartlet said he'd be president someday.

Sam is a great character, easily lovable, but because he is, as said before, more emotionally even, even-keeled, outwardly kind, etc, but because he is neither a brooding cauldron of angst and despair like Toby nor a pressure-cooker of feverish restlessness and intensity like Josh, he is actually just a little bit less interesting than them as a character.

**6. Dr. Abigail ""Abbey"" Bartlet / Portrayed by Stockard Channing**

**Appeared In: 57 Episodes(+12 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: First Lady Of The United States, Seasons 1-7**

This will probably be the most disagreed-with placement on this list.  I can feel your side-eyes and WTF expressions.

Abbey is, for some reason, a polarizing character.  I, for one, love her.  She is one half of the most believable couple I've ever seen on a TV show, and imo her character elevates Jed and makes him better, while at the same time standing as a formidable woman, a woman to be reckoned with, in her own right.

I've always thought Stockard Channing was magnificent in the role, some of the best work of her career, fully deserving of the Emmy she won for her work in the third season(""Gone Quiet"", ""Dead Irish Writers"").  She really sold the character as a real, breathing person with her own personality, her own considerable mind, her own dreams and regrets and motivations, her own career, who made a big sacrifice with said career for her husband(first by giving up her work, and then by voluntarily giving up her medical license).  She has her own politics, her own disappointments, her own resentments, but above all she loves her husband and her children fiercely.  She has just always felt like such a real, lived character.

I love the arguments between the two of them, how they challenge each other.  Whether it's the showdown in ""The White House Pro-Am"" about Bartlet ""handling"" her, the ""we had a deal"" spat and everything surrounding it in ""Bartlet's Third State of the Union""/""The War At Home"", or the extended argument in ""Manchester"" after he decides to run again, she can stand up to Jed and take him down a peg like no one else, can say things to him that no one else can say, because when it's just the two of them, he's not the president, he's just her husband.  I think it shows a healthy relationship as they don't keep things inside, the duke it out, and more often than not, they end up making up and moving forward.

That's not to discount the more tender moments they share - as you need both the arguments and the tender moments to paint a full and realistic portrait of this couple and this woman.  There are many examples.  Think of the end of ""And It's Surely To Their Credit"" - Bartlet has been clear to be intimate with his wife again after the shooting, but Abbey had punished for making fun of Nellie Bly, so at the episode's conclusion he makes his radio address all about historically important women to atone, and this playful exchange ensues:

&gt;TECHNICIAN: We're out.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Do it live, that's what I always say.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Very nice, babe.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: By the way, sweet knees, the Statue of Liberty.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Get upstairs.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Right there at the front door to the country!  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Get upstairs.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Like a lawn jockey.  
&gt;  
&gt;C.J.: \[comes in\] Mr. President?  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Ah, C.J., the President's going to take a little personal staff time right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: No, it's okay. \[stage whispers\] I'll be right behind you.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Special garment...  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Go.  
&gt;  
&gt;Abbey leaves.

Think of that conversation with Oliver Babbish in ""18th and Potomac"" in which he's urging her not to do the interview with Bartlet, and they argue for a bit, and she finally says to him, in a more vulnerable voice:

&gt;I'd like to be next to my husband when he does this

Or her conversation with Bartlet in the car at the end of Manchester, Part II, in which they make up after being distant all episode:

&gt;BARTLET: Did you know that hardly any of the guys who landed on the moon are married to the same people they were married to before they went there?  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (looks at him, puzzled) What?  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'm just saying it could be worse. I could've been an astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (slightly amused, but concealing it) You could not have been an astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'd have been a great astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: You're afraid of heights, speed, fire, and small places.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'd have overcome it to go to the moon.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (pauses to look at him)I know you would have.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: (pauses to look at her) I'm really happy you're introducing me. I'm really happy about that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Neither one of them says anything for a few moments.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: There's something important I have to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Say it.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I haven't really made up my mind yet... but at the moment... I'm leaning towards voting for you.  
&gt;  
&gt;They look at each other for several moments, hints of smiles on their faces.  Then he looks back out the window.

Or her conversation with Bartlet in ""Dead Irish Writers"", in which she tells me she's forfeiting her medical license:

&gt;Bartlet holds out his hand and takes Abbey aside. The band continues to play.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I called Nolan. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm sorry. The rules are different when it comes to my family. There isn't a man in America who doesn't understand that. I also think partiality isn't a vice in this case. He knows you, and that's a good thing. He's gonna consider not recusing himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I'm gonna voluntarily forfeit my license for the duration of our stay in the White House.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her decision comes as a surprise. Bartlet is speechless. The guests start to sing.  
&gt;  
&gt;GUESTS O, Canada, our home and native land True patriot love in all thy sons' command With glowing hearts, we see thee rise...  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet finally conjures up a response.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Okay. I'm gonna do a toast and everything in a minute, and I'll tell the ditch story, but I wanted to say that I love you very much.  
&gt;  
&gt;Abbey is taken aback, fighting back tears.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I love you too, Jethro.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Don't call me that.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I think I will.

In ""Game On"", just before Bartlet goes on stage for the debate, Abbey is affectionate towards him, and also cuts his tie off for luck:

&gt;ABBEY: We'll do mushy later. So, for now, I just got to say I love you so much that my head's going to fly off. But, more importantly, game on, boyfriend! Let's go!  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Okay.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: By the way, I feel bad. I don't think I've done enough to help you prepare for this debate.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Why are you telling me this now?  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet turns around to look back, when Abbey pulls out a pair of scissors and cuts off his tie.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Just 'cause.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet looks down at his tie, then up at Abbey who has a sly grin on her face.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Oh, my God. You're insane. Are you...? You're insane! Charlie!

Or ""Process Stories"", in which she and Bartlet are being all playful with one another on election night after he's won re-election.

I could go on, but you get the idea.  She's just a great combination of a woman with her own life, work, ambitions, etc, a good mother, and a loving wife who can tear her husband a new one when necessary and show great affection in equal measure.  She's a complex character, and those are usually the best.

I will add the caveat that I don't love the season 5 storyline where she temporarily leaves Jed any more than the rest of you, but I can easily overlook it, because she is almost uniformly a great character before and after that.

For all the criticism Sorkin gets for not writing women well, he created, imo, two of the best female television characters of the last twenty years in Abbey and the next character on the list.

Continued below...",1, ranking character the regular so over a year ago i started this project of ranking character in late 2017 i posted the one offs sometime in spring 2018 i posted the 2 4 recurring episode thread then late last summer i posted the 5 10 episode recurring and 11 episode recurring thread in close proximity to each other all of those list garnered positive reception though the most recent 11 episode recurring one garnered some rather heated disagreement over my placement of ainsley hayes she wa 10 overall not that low and even bob russell if don t remember or weren t around when those thread were posted here are the link to the previous post to refresh your memory maybe have a look http www reddit com r thewestwing comment 92q7xb ranking _characters _11 _episode

ranking_characters_the_oneoffs anyway i got sidetracked with other thing so it s been a while but today i m posting the final installment of the project this ha taken me a while to write i mean it s a hell of a lot of writing so i hope someone actually take the time to read it all most probably won t oh well i m actually posting two list here the first will be a brief list ranking and acknowledging some of what we ll call the non credited regular character who are seen on a regular basis but are never seen in the credit these are mostly assistant but there are a couple of others a well the second list will be the main one the fifteen character who have appeared in the opening credit with much more writing than the first list without further ado non credited regular 8 cathy portrayed by suzy nakamura appeared in 9 episode season 1 cathy wa an additional assistant that sam had for nine episode in the first season after which she went to mandyville she is often forgotten in conversation like this not much say to really 7 nancy portrayed by renee estevez appeared in 44 episode season 1 7 played by martin sheen s daughter nancy wa a direct assistant to the president seen every now and then coming in and out of whatever room he s in to tell him that so and so is here or such and such want to speak to him among other thing 6 white house press corp reporter katie witt mark o donnell steve and chris portrayed by kris murphy timothy davis reed charles noland and mindy seeger katie witt appeared in 53 episode season 1 7 mark o donnell appeared in 43 episode season 1 7 steve appeared in 52 episode season 2 7 chris appeared in 34 episode season 1 7 ok so these are the four and i think they re the only one press corp reporter that appear regularly with dialogue i felt it wa important to acknowledge them because having some familiar face in the press room throughout add continuity and make the show feel more realistic in those scene i ve included the four of them together instead of individually because none of them ha enough screen time to have gotten to know any of them but together they should be acknowledged if you don t know who they are by name here are some photo to jog your memory steve and chris don t have last name because they don t have last name on imdb http vignette wikia nocookie net westwing image d d8 katiewitt jpg revision latest cb

westwing image d dd chris jpg revision latest cb 20090219081138 5 bonnie portrayed by devika parikh appeared in 41 episode season 1 5 one of two long term assistant in the communication office who served toby and sam and later will always being given many order always dependable disappeared for some reason in the post sorkin year 4 ed amp larry portrayed by peter james smith and william duffy appeared in 47 48 episode respectively season 1 7 i feel like ed amp larry existed because while toby had people who reported directly to him sam c j will josh never did outside of donna they were there to make it look like there were other people working under josh so they re often seen in meeting about legislative type thing they seem competent enough and they re funny too from time to time 3 ginger portrayed by kim webster appeared in 58 episode season 1 7 the other long term assistant in the communication office i ve always felt that kim webster really gave ginger a good deal of personality in her relatively limited screen time she always seemed feisty unintimidated not afraid to give toby some lip from time to time i always liked her 2 carol fitzpatrick portrayed by melissa fitzgerald appeared in 102 episode season 1 7 c j s right hand in the press office still seen but le so after c j becomes chief of staff she wa always such a positive person happy to be there and uber competent at her job a well always liked that her and c j seemed to have a genuine friendship seems like everybody like carol 1 margaret hooper portrayed by nicole robinson appeared in 106 episode season 1 7 the obvious 1 here the executive assistant to the chief of staff under both leo and c j margaret wa a wonderfully kooky offbeat character nicole robinson deserves all the credit in the world for bringing her to life her eccentric demeanor can sometimes mask the fact that she is a good a anybody could be at her job that leo and c j would be lost without her and that she care deeply about her boss and her job i think c j got right to the point with this bit of dialogue gt you re an odd woman i ve never understood you but you re extremely capable you run this office like a watch you re tall which is reassuring leo may need you and if he doe that s okay but if he s willing to part with you i hope you ll stay margaret is a memorable is any other character and now the final list the regular and we reach the final list of the project a an aside it s never easy to put character in an order like this much le the main character some decision were easier than others the top seven in particular wa murderously difficult to put in order aside from the top two which were a given to me at the outset all of these character are so great it hurt to put anyone lower than they might have been but i figure there s no order i can put them in that won t piss somebody off so i may a well just put them in the order i feel is right which after much deliberation and mind changing is exactly what i have done without further ado 15 mandy hampton portrayed by moira kelly appeared in 20 episode 2 credit only season 1 title white house medium consultant season 1 a if it wa going to be anybody else at 15 moira kelly is a great actress i don t think anyone ha ever blamed her but the character just wa not likable she didn t fit in the show wa an idealistic aspirational view of government and in the sorkin year it wa different post sorkin the conflict wa always between bartlet s staff and whoever wa opposing them it wa them against the world that dynamic wa essential to what made the show what it wa having someone inside the team constantly arguing with and antagonizing other member of the team didn t work additionally she just came across a a shallow person she seemed to always care more about how something looked or how something would play than about what the administration wa actually doing yes her job wa a a medium consultant but c j s job dealt with the medium a well and she always cared 100 a much about the real stuff a she did about how it played hell she probably cared more about the real stuff the character just didn t work well although i ve never been a fan of character just disappearing without explanation 14 kate harper portrayed by mary mccormack appeared in 30 episode 18 credit only season 5 7 title deputy national security advisor season 5 7 iirc kate wa not a very popular character at the time when the post sorkin season were first airing but ha maybe grown a little in popularity over the year there are several issue with kate imo one is that like mandy she is more of a pragmatist in a world populated with idealist bartlet s staff were all to varying degree passionate and partisan and would breathe fire to defend their conviction in contrast kate wa not a politician or a political operative having come from a military defense background and would often come off a colder and more dispassionate i just felt like it didn t jive a lot of the time another is that she essentially ended up replacing the far superior character of nancy mcnally nancy appears in 20 episode total and talking point in which she introduces kate to bartlet and u near the end of season 5 is the 17th she only appeared in three more episode in the following two season any time nancy would ve ordinarily been there kate is there instead if that wa the intent i can t support it to me after many re watch it just seems to me that well and his team knew ahead of time that josh wa going to leave the wh in season 6 that leo wa going to be in a reduced role that will wa going to be on the campaign trail a lot and that with basically only bartlet c j and toby left they simply needed another character to be in the wh a a regular with a few exception the middle east peace summit at the beginning of season 6 her plot were usually filler and not all that important 13 annabeth schott portrayed by kristin chenoweth appeared in 23 epsiodes 11 credit only season 6 7 title deputy press secretary season 6 aide to democratic vice presidential candidate leo mcgarry season 7 annabeth would ve been higher on this list if she d appeared in more episode kristen chenoweth ha a magnetic personality and she succeeds in the delicate balancing act of making the character so relentlessly upbeat and bright and positive without being annoying it s impossible not to like her yet despite the happy nature of the character her most memorable and effective scene is easily in the hospital in election day part 2 when her face drenched in tear she informs josh and u that leo mcgarry ha passed on chenoweth killed it in that scene i want to rank her higher but a likable a she is her role just wasn t substantial enough to put any higher 12 will bailey portrayed by joshua malina appeared in 71 episode 9 credit only season 4 7 title white house deputy director of communication season 4 chief of staff to the vice president of the united state season 5 campaign manager russell campaign season 6 white house director of communication season 7 will is perhaps the most frustrating character on this list and i struggled with where to place him the will of season 4 is a genuinely likable guy a little aloof a little in over his head but a good guy super intelligent hard worker awed by where he find himself working in the white house but his character wa essentially sacrificed in season 5 the awed aloof guy who believed in certain principle enough to get a dead guy elected who excelled at speechwriting turned into an ambition driven operative in order to set him up a russell s campaign manager and josh s foil in the season 6 primary and then in season 7 he s almost an afterthought his most memorable moment being his ascension to the title of white house director of communication after toby s firing and his much maligned romance with kate it wa a decent idea on paper but they had no chemistry malina is a good actor anything that went wrong with the character wa not his fault at all and when i see will in his good moment it frustrates me because of what he could ve been but his bad moment when he s reduced to acting so punk ish to josh and so forth because the plot call for it are enough to drag him down this low 11 matthew matt santos portrayed by jimmy smits appeared in 35 episode 2 credit only season 6 7 title united state congressman from texas season 6 democratic nominee for president of the united state president elect of the united state season 7 i think both of the season 6 7 candidate character were well written and well performed and had either of them existed for longer than 1 5 season they d probably rank higher on the list but they were only around for a small slice of the show so i can t see ranking either any higher than this though they were always going to be at the top of 10 15 range a they are pretty easily the best written and best performed and most important of those character i put santos one rung lower than vinick and the reason will be clear in the vinick write up for right now i ll just say what i like about santos the character wa conceived shortly after obama s 2004 convention speech he wa based on obama and some might say in turn had some influence on the 2008 election in which obama wa elected in real life the character wa supposed to have many of the same characteristic a the real obama young charismatic unabashedly liberal etc santos displayed two trait throughout the campaign integrity and insecurity integrity in that he didn t want to do an attack ad in freedonia in that he didn t initially want to make a photo op out of his service a a military reserve integrity in turning russell s vp offer down integrity in not bowing out at the convention because it s not my place to decide who the nominee should be that decision is yours and yours alone also if you believe the story he told vinick and i see no reason not to he displayed integrity in stepping up to support his irresponsible brother s child because it wa the right thing to do he wa insecure about his ability to play the game of presidential politics especially at the beginning there were a number of occasion in which josh would have to teach santos how to play the game and santos would express frustration at having to do what in his view were such trivial thing instead of talking about real issue that mattered i appreciated his willingness and determination to hold onto his integrity in the face of losing of not being comfortable with the game of presidential politics until he could figure out how to play it on his own term in term of policy he wa an ideal liberal and nowhere wa that more front and center than in the debate episode in which he advocated for medicare for all green energy public education and more and put a bow on it with his defense of the liberal label gt yes a liberal republican senator what happened to them they got run out of your party what did liberal do that wa so offensive to the liberal party i ll tell you what they did liberal got woman the right to vote liberal got african american the right to vote liberal created social security and lifted million of elderly people out of poverty liberal ended segregation liberal passed the civil right act the voting right act liberal created medicare liberal passed the clean air act the clean water act what did conservative do they opposed them on every one of those thing every one so when you try to hurl that label at my foot liberal a if it were something to be ashamed of something dirty something to run away from it won t work senator because i will pick up that label and i will wear it a a badge of honor matt santos wa a great charismatic character a beacon of liberalism and share many quality with obama whom i consider to be the one of the greatest president we ve had so why is he above vinick read on 10 arnold vinick portrayed by alan alda appeared in 18 episode 10 credit only season 6 7 title united state senator from california season 6 republican nominee for president of the united state secretary of state designate season 7 so why vinick above santos because vinick is a republican whose politics i vehemently disagree with and who i would never vote for against any decently capable democrat but who i still like a great deal and i know many share that opinion to create such a character on a show dominated by very vocal liberal and democrat whose audience is mostly very liberal is from both a writing and acting standpoint simply a heavier lift than to create a character like santos it s that simple from a writing standpoint to create a moderate republican a liberal republican a pro choice republican from california wa a great contrast to the rightward lurch the party wa experiencing and continues to experience in real life to use the platform to show what a republican used to be and what it still could be wa ingenious from an acting standpoint they hit a home run with alda i mean jimmy smits is a very good actor he is but alda is a legendary actor a national treasure he played the character note perfectly made him a three dimensional complicated genuine well intentioned downright warm person i really don t think the character would ve worked nearly a well a it did or been liked a much a he wa in the hand of a lesser actor alda is probably the 1 reason i m ranking vinick this high i d also mention that like santos vinick wa also a man of great integrity when bruno found santos s briefcase and gave it to vinick a lot of candidate would ve ran with it but what did vinick do he set up a meeting with santos gave him a chance to explain himself took him at his word and didn t use it in the al smith dinner he ultimately chose to denounce the ad attacking santos s pro choice position even though it would ve scored him point with the right wing because it would ve been disingenuous on his part not to in in god we trust he declined to go to church because it would ve been phony gt look i respect reverend butler and i respect his church too much to use it for my own political purpose and that s exactly what i d be doing if i went down there this sunday because the truth is it would just be an act of political phoniness i may be wrong but i suspect our church already have enough political phony in them gt gt senator do you or do you not gt gt i don t see how we can have a separation of church and state in this government if you have to pas a religious test to get in this government and i wanna warn everyone in the press and all the voter out there if you demand expression of religious faith from politician you are just begging to be lied to they won t all lie to you but a lot of them will and it ll be the easiest lie they ever had to tell to get your vote so every day until the end of this campaign i ll answer any question anyone ha on government but if you have a question on religion please go to church thank you finally in election day part 2 after receiving news of leo s death vinick s advisor tell him he should challenge a santos win on ground of tainted elector in the wake of leo s passing vinick refuse to use leo s death that way gt how about creating a conscience for ourselves i ve known leo for 20 year can we please not use him a a step stool aside from all of that i thought both the writer and alda did a great job of showing the humanity within the politician particularly towards the end when he got sick from shaking so many hand and then after the election in the last hurrah when we get to see go overnight from almost being president to being relatively speaking no one he wa just a great thought provoking character despite being politically the opposite of me and most of the show s audience here is a demarcation point i consider all of the character ahead to be the core cast they are the family the character 15 10 are not in the family not even will these are the character who were there from beginning to end even if it took charlie a couple episode to appear and even if sam wa gone for a few year 9 charlie young portrayed by dule hill appeared in 131 episode 6 credit only season 1 7 title personal aide to the president season 1 6 deputy special assistant aide to the white house chief of staff season 6 7 charlie wa an improbable character a college age kid whose father wasn t in his life whose mother wa killed who at such a young age wa thrust into being the primary guardian over his younger sister who then later on became the target of an act of terror you might think that such a person might be hardened cynical jaded but charlie somehow remains emotionally open the combination of that emotional maturity uncommon intelligence and general kind demeanor is what defines the character watching this wounded kid take advantage of the opportunity of a lifetime watching him grow up before our eye watching his relationship with bartlet blossom a they become surrogate father and son watching his on and off relationship the first daughter zoey is a joy i enjoy his snarkiness from time to time a well in shibboleth he and mr landingham have the following exchange about the knife gt mr landingham he s very particular gt gt charlie that s one word for it in gone quiet he and bartlet have this conversation gt bartlet that make sense also there s a chance i could get hit getting on or off gt gt charlie laugh a little yeah gt gt bartlet excuse me gt gt charlie sir gt gt bartlet you think i m not tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propeller on marine one gt gt charlie i think dikembe mutombo isn t tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propeller on marine one and in arctic radar after bartlet scream at the un secretary general about parking ticket charlie responds with perfect timing gt bartlet screaming there are big sign you can t park there they should get towed i hope they get towed to queen and the triboro is closed and there s a big craft show at shea a flea market or a tractor show gt gt he hang up gt gt charlie well that wa probably his secretary gt gt bartlet damn it gt gt charlie you can bet she ll be parking it in a garage though charlie s awesome 8 donnatella donna moss portrayed by janel moloney appeared in 142 episode 8 credit only season 1 7 title senior assistant to the white house deputy chief of staff season 1 6 aide spokeswoman russell campaign season 6 spokeswoman santos campaign season 7 who doesn t love donna there s her kind sweet disposition excepting the time josh annoys her past her breaking point she always ha a warmth about her she always ha a bright and sunny outlook and always care for others this is evident in the way she always take care of josh on a personal level she s often the only one who can calm him down when he s worked up how she wa all worried in the fall s gonna kill you about a satellite falling to earth and potentially hurting people how she wanted a proclamation for her teacher mr morello in stirred and so on she s also highly intelligent competent and resourceful she is portrayed a kind of flaky sometimes but i think that s a mirage like in that flashback in in the shadow of two gunman where donna claim to have had five major and two minor i actually take that to mean she ha a degree of intellectual curiosity such that she can t decide which subject to stick with this is a person that didn t have the clear path that pretty much every other character on this list other than charlie did she didn t go to or graduate from elite school she had no big career plan none of that to go from where she wa coming off the street with no degree or experience to boldly start working for someone who never hired you to scratch and claw and work so hard and get up where did doing what she did you can t do that if you re not a highly intelligent individual and over the year she became uber competent at her job and invaluable to her superior her girl next door look don t hurt either i think donna had one of the best post sorkin arc and therefore one of the best overall arc of any character in term of growth while she wa uber competent at her job over the year she began to feel like she wa outgrowing being someone s assistant like she wanted to do more this became an underlying source of tension a i m sure josh at least subconsciously wa afraid of losing her in more way than one and thus dragged his foot in term of giving her opportunity for growth despite doing it in little way like sending her to gaza a part of the model so she left him and went out and grew a a person and a a professional before they finally re connected during the general election and she got to end her story becoming the chief of staff to the incoming first lady it s just a satisfying character arc for a good person who deserved good thing she started a a 20 something looking for her place in the world and ended up having found it and then some 7 sam seaborne portrayed by rob lowe appeared in 80 episode 5 credit only title white house deputy director of communication season 1 4 white house deputy chief of staff designate season 7 the og main character sam wa a different breed than than josh and toby whereas the latter two and even leo went straight into politics sam is the only one that actually practiced law perhaps this is why he often seems more level headed even keeled emotionally adjusted than josh and toby and why his style of argument might seem more disciplined whereas josh and toby use a more impassioned fiery mode of debate because of all of this sam is perhaps more likely to to see the bigger picture in certain case where josh and toby would be more likely to be focused on the trench in the political fight of the moment they live for the political fight they fight like their life depend on it sam can certainly get worked up when he want to but in general he s more likely to be pragmatic to compromise and fight another day he doesn t need politics the way they do hence his decision to practice law instead multiple time i think they also differ in that josh and toby to quote bartlet want to be the guy the guy depends on sam sometimes behaves more like he want to eventually be the guy maybe that s why bartlet said he d be president someday sam is a great character easily lovable but because he is a said before more emotionally even even keeled outwardly kind etc but because he is neither a brooding cauldron of angst and despair like toby nor a pressure cooker of feverish restlessness and intensity like josh he is actually just a little bit le interesting than them a a character 6 dr abigail abbey bartlet portrayed by stockard channing appeared in 57 episode 12 credit only season 1 7 title first lady of the united state season 1 7 this will probably be the most disagreed with placement on this list i can feel your side eye and wtf expression abbey is for some reason a polarizing character i for one love her she is one half of the most believable couple i ve ever seen on a tv show and imo her character elevates jed and make him better while at the same time standing a a formidable woman a woman to be reckoned with in her own right i ve always thought stockard channing wa magnificent in the role some of the best work of her career fully deserving of the emmy she won for her work in the third season gone quiet dead irish writer she really sold the character a a real breathing person with her own personality her own considerable mind her own dream and regret and motivation her own career who made a big sacrifice with said career for her husband first by giving up her work and then by voluntarily giving up her medical license she ha her own politics her own disappointment her own resentment but above all she love her husband and her child fiercely she ha just always felt like such a real lived character i love the argument between the two of them how they challenge each other whether it s the showdown in the white house pro am about bartlet handling her the we had a deal spat and everything surrounding it in bartlet s third state of the union the war at home or the extended argument in manchester after he decides to run again she can stand up to jed and take him down a peg like no one else can say thing to him that no one else can say because when it s just the two of them he s not the president he s just her husband i think it show a healthy relationship a they don t keep thing inside the duke it out and more often than not they end up making up and moving forward that s not to discount the more tender moment they share a you need both the argument and the tender moment to paint a full and realistic portrait of this couple and this woman there are many example think of the end of and it s surely to their credit bartlet ha been clear to be intimate with his wife again after the shooting but abbey had punished for making fun of nellie bly so at the episode s conclusion he make his radio address all about historically important woman to atone and this playful exchange ensues gt technician we re out gt gt bartlet do it live that s what i always say gt gt abbey very nice

for a bit and she finally say to him in a more vulnerable voice gt i d like to be next to my husband when he doe this or her conversation with bartlet in the car at the end of manchester part ii in which they make up after being distant all episode gt bartlet did you know that hardly any of the guy who landed on the moon are married to the same people they were married to before they went there

his hand and take abbey aside the band continues to play gt gt bartlet i called nolan i know i shouldn t have but i m sorry the rule are different when it come to my family there isn t a man in

forfeit my license for the duration of our stay in the white house gt gt her decision come a a surprise bartlet is speechless the guest start to sing gt gt guest o canada our home and native land true

the ditch story but i wanted to say that i love you very much gt gt abbey is taken aback fighting back tear gt gt abbey i love you too jethro gt gt bartlet don t call me that gt gt abbey i think i will in game on just before bartlet go on stage for the debate abbey is affectionate towards him and also cut his tie off for luck gt abbey we ll do mushy later so for now i just got to say i love you so much that my head s going to fly off but more importantly game on boyfriend let s go gt gt bartlet okay gt gt abbey by the way i feel bad i don t think i ve done enough to help you prepare for this debate gt gt bartlet why are you telling me this now gt gt bartlet turn around to look back when abbey pull out a pair of scissors and cut off his tie gt gt abbey just cause gt gt bartlet look down at his tie then up at abbey who ha a sly grin on her face gt gt bartlet oh my god you re insane are you you re insane charlie or process story in which she and bartlet are being all playful with one another on election night after he s won re election i could go on but you get the idea she s just a great combination of a woman with her own life work ambition etc a good mother and a loving wife who can tear her husband a new one when necessary and show great affection in equal measure she s a complex character and those are usually the best i will add the caveat that i don t love the season 5 storyline where she temporarily leaf jed any more than the rest of you but i can easily overlook it because she is almost uniformly a great character before and after that for all the criticism sorkin get for not writing woman well he created imo two of the best female television character of the last twenty year in abbey and the next character on the list continued below, rank charact the

serv tobi and sam and later will alway be given mani order alway depend disappear for some reason in the post sorkin year 4 ed amp larri portray by peter jame smith and william duffi appear in 47 48 episod respect season 1 7 i feel like ed amp larri exist becaus while tobi had peopl who report directli to him sam c j will josh never did outsid of donna they were there to make it look like there were other peopl work under josh so they re often seen in meet about legisl type thing they seem compet enough and they re funni too from time to time 3 ginger portray by kim webster appear in 58 episod season 1 7 the other long term assist in the commun offic i ve alway felt that kim webster realli gave ginger a good deal of person in her rel limit screen time she alway seem feisti unintimid not afraid to give tobi some lip from time to time i alway like her 2 carol fitzpatrick portray by melissa fitzgerald appear in 102 episod season 1 7 c j s right hand in the press offic still seen but less so after c j becom chief of staff she wa alway such a posit person happi to be there and uber compet at her job as well alway like that her and c j seem to have a genuin friendship seem like everybodi like carol 1 margaret hooper portray by nicol robinson appear in 106 episod season 1 7 the obviou 1 here the execut assist to the chief of staff under both leo and c j margaret wa a wonder kooki offbeat charact nicol robinson deserv all the credit in the world for bring her to life her eccentr demeanor can sometim mask the fact that she is as good as anybodi could be at her job that leo and c j would be lost without her and that she care deepli about her boss and her job i think c j got right to the point with thi bit of dialogu gt you re an odd woman i ve never understood you but you re extrem capabl you run thi offic like a watch you re tall which is reassur leo may need you and if he doe that s okay but if he s will to part with you i hope you ll stay margaret is as memor is ani other charact and now the final list the regular and we reach the final list of the project as an asid it s never easi to put charact in an order like thi much less the main charact some decis were easier than other the top seven in particular wa murder difficult to put in order asid from the top two which were a given to me at the outset all of these charact are so great it hurt to put anyon lower than they might have been but i figur there s no order i can put them in that won t piss somebodi off so i may as well just put them in the order i feel is right which after much deliber and mind chang is exactli what i have done without further ado 15 mandi hampton portray by moira kelli appear in 20 episod 2 credit onli season 1 titl white hous media consult season 1 as if it wa go to be anybodi els at 15 moira kelli is a great actress i don t think anyon ha ever blame her but the charact just wa not likabl she didn t fit in the show wa an idealist aspir view of govern and in the sorkin year it wa differ post sorkin the conflict wa alway between bartlet s staff and whoever wa oppos them it wa them against the world that dynam wa essenti to what made the show what it wa have someon insid the team constantli argu with and antagon other member of the team didn t work addit she just came across as a shallow person she seem to alway care more about how someth look or how someth would play than about what the administr wa actual do ye her job wa as a media consult but c j s job dealt with the media as well and she alway care 100 as much about the real stuff as she did about how it play hell she probabl care more about the real stuff the charact just didn t work well although i ve never been a fan of charact just disappear without explan 14 kate harper portray by mari mccormack appear in 30 episod 18 credit onli season 5 7 titl deputi nation secur advisor season 5 7 iirc kate wa not a veri popular charact at the time when the post sorkin season were first air but ha mayb grown a littl in popular over the year there are sever issu with kate imo one is that like mandi she is more of a pragmatist in a world popul with idealist bartlet s staff were all to vari degre passion and partisan and would breath fire to defend their convict in contrast kate wa not a politician or a polit oper have come from a militari defens background and would often come off as colder and more dispassion i just felt like it didn t jive a lot of the time anoth is that she essenti end up replac the far superior charact of nanci mcnalli nanci appear in 20 episod total and talk point in which she introduc kate to bartlet and us near the end of season 5 is the 17th she onli appear in three more episod in the follow two season ani time nanci would ve ordinarili been there kate is there instead if that wa the intent i can t support it to me after mani re watch it just seem to me that well and hi team knew ahead of time that josh wa go to leav the wh in season 6 that leo wa go to be in a reduc role that will wa go to be on the campaign trail a lot and that with basic onli bartlet c j and tobi left they simpli need anoth charact to be in the wh as a regular with a few except the middl east peac summit at the begin of season 6 her plot were usual filler and not all that import 13 annabeth schott portray by kristin chenoweth appear in 23 epsiod 11 credit onli season 6 7 titl deputi press secretari season 6 aid to democrat vice presidenti candid leo mcgarri season 7 annabeth would ve been higher on thi list if she d appear in more episod kristen chenoweth ha a magnet person and she succe in the delic balanc act of make the charact so relentlessli upbeat and bright and posit without be annoy it s imposs not to like her yet despit the happi natur of the charact her most memor and effect scene is easili in the hospit in elect day part 2 when her face drench in tear she inform josh and us that leo mcgarri ha pass on chenoweth kill it in that scene i want to rank her higher but as likabl as she is her role just wasn t substanti enough to put ani higher 12 will bailey portray by joshua malina appear in 71 episod 9 credit onli season 4 7 titl white hous deputi director of commun season 4 chief of staff to the vice presid of the unit state season 5 campaign manag russel campaign season 6 white hous director of commun season 7 will is perhap the most frustrat charact on thi list and i struggl with where to place him the will of season 4 is a genuin likabl guy a littl aloof a littl in over hi head but a good guy super intellig hard worker awe by where he find himself work in the white hous but hi charact wa essenti sacrif in season 5 the awe aloof guy who believ in certain principl enough to get a dead guy elect who excel at speechwrit turn into an ambit driven oper in order to set him up as russel s campaign manag and josh s foil in the season 6 primari and then in season 7 he s almost an afterthought hi most memor moment be hi ascens to the titl of white hous director of commun after tobi s fire and hi much malign romanc with kate it wa a decent idea on paper but they had no chemistri malina is a good actor anyth that went wrong with the charact wa not hi fault at all and when i see will in hi good moment it frustrat me becaus of what he could ve been but hi bad moment when he s reduc to act so punk ish to josh and so forth becaus the plot call for it are enough to drag him down thi low 11 matthew matt santo portray by jimmi smit appear in 35 episod 2 credit onli season 6 7 titl unit state congressman from texa season 6 democrat nomine for presid of the unit state presid elect of the unit state season 7 i think both of the season 6 7 candid charact were well written and well perform and had either of them exist for longer than 1 5 season they d probabl rank higher on the list but they were onli around for a small slice of the show so i can t see rank either ani higher than thi though they were alway go to be at the top of 10 15 rang as they are pretti easili the best written and best perform and most import of those charact i put santo one rung lower than vinick and the reason will be clear in the vinick write up for right now i ll just say what i like about santo the charact wa conceiv shortli after obama s 2004 convent speech he wa base on obama and some might say in turn had some influenc on the 2008 elect in which obama wa elect in real life the charact wa suppos to have mani of the same characterist as the real obama young charismat unabashedli liber etc santo display two trait throughout the campaign integr and insecur integr in that he didn t want to do an attack ad in freedonia in that he didn t initi want to make a photo op out of hi servic as a militari reserv integr in turn russel s vp offer down integr in not bow out at the convent becaus it s not my place to decid who the nomine should be that decis is your and your alon also if you believ the stori he told vinick and i see no reason not to he display integr in step up to support hi irrespons brother s child becaus it wa the right thing to do he wa insecur about hi abil to play the game of presidenti polit especi at the begin there were a number of occas in which josh would have to teach santo how to play the game and santo would express frustrat at have to do what in hi view were such trivial thing instead of talk about real issu that matter i appreci hi willing and determin to hold onto hi integr in the face of lose of not be comfort with the game of presidenti polit until he could figur out how to play it on hi own term in term of polici he wa an ideal liber and nowher wa that more front and center than in the debat episod in which he advoc for medicar for all green energi public educ and more and put a bow on it with hi defens of the liber label gt ye a liber republican senat what happen to them they got run out of your parti what did liber do that wa so offens to the liber parti i ll tell you what they did liber got women the right to vote liber got african american the right to vote liber creat social secur and lift million of elderli peopl out of poverti liber end segreg liber pass the civil right act the vote right act liber creat medicar liber pass the clean air act the clean water act what did conserv do they oppos them on everi one of those thing everi one so when you tri to hurl that label at my feet liber as if it were someth to be asham of someth dirti someth to run away from it won t work senat becaus i will pick up that label and i will wear it as a badg of honor matt santo wa a great charismat charact a beacon of liber and share mani qualiti with obama whom i consid to be the one of the greatest presid we ve had so whi is he abov vinick read on 10 arnold vinick portray by alan alda appear in 18 episod 10 credit onli season 6 7 titl unit state senat from california season 6 republican nomine for presid of the unit state secretari of state design season 7 so whi vinick abov santo becaus vinick is a republican whose polit i vehement disagre with and who i would never vote for against ani decent capabl democrat but who i still like a great deal and i know mani share that opinion to creat such a charact on a show domin by veri vocal liber and democrat whose audienc is mostli veri liber is from both a write and act standpoint simpli a heavier lift than to creat a charact like santo it s that simpl from a write standpoint to creat a moder republican a liber republican a pro choic republican from california wa a great contrast to the rightward lurch the parti wa experienc and continu to experi in real life to use the platform to show what a republican use to be and what it still could be wa ingeni from an act standpoint they hit a home run with alda i mean jimmi smit is a veri good actor he is but alda is a legendari actor a nation treasur he play the charact note perfectli made him a three dimension complic genuin well intent downright warm person i realli don t think the charact would ve work nearli as well as it did or been like as much as he wa in the hand of a lesser actor alda is probabl the 1 reason i m rank vinick thi high i d also mention that like santo vinick wa also a man of great integr when bruno found santo s briefcas and gave it to vinick a lot of candid would ve ran with it but what did vinick do he set up a meet with santo gave him a chanc to explain himself took him at hi word and didn t use it in the al smith dinner he ultim chose to denounc the ad attack santo s pro choic posit even though it would ve score him point with the right wing becaus it would ve been disingenu on hi part not to in in god we trust he declin to go to church becaus it would ve been phoni gt look i respect reverend butler and i respect hi church too much to use it for my own polit purpos and that s exactli what i d be do if i went down there thi sunday becaus the truth is it would just be an act of polit phoni i may be wrong but i suspect our church alreadi have enough polit phoni in them gt gt senat do you or do you not gt gt i don t see how we can have a separ of church and state in thi govern if you have to pass a religi test to get in thi govern and i wanna warn everyon in the press and all the voter out there if you demand express of religi faith from politician you are just beg to be lie to they won t all lie to you but a lot of them will and it ll be the easiest lie they ever had to tell to get your vote so everi day until the end of thi campaign i ll answer ani question anyon ha on govern but if you have a question on religion pleas go to church thank you final in elect day part 2 after receiv news of leo s death vinick s advisor tell him he should challeng a santo win on ground of taint elector in the wake of leo s pass vinick refus to use leo s death that way gt how about creat a conscienc for ourselv i ve known leo for 20 year can we pleas not use him as a step stool asid from all of that i thought both the writer and alda did a great job of show the human within the politician particularli toward the end when he got sick from shake so mani hand and then after the elect in the last hurrah when we get to see go overnight from almost be presid to be rel speak no one he wa just a great thought provok charact despit be polit the opposit of me and most of the show s audienc here is a demarc point i consid all of the charact ahead to be the core cast they are the famili the charact 15 10 are not in the famili not even will these are the charact who were there from begin to end even if it took charli a coupl episod to appear and even if sam wa gone for a few year 9 charli young portray by dule hill appear in 131 episod 6 credit onli season 1 7 titl person aid to

a young age wa thrust into be the primari guardian over hi younger sister who then later on becam the target of an act of terror you might think that such a person might be harden cynic jade but charli somehow remain emot open the combin of that emot matur uncommon intellig and gener kind demeanor is what defin the charact watch thi wound kid take advantag of the opportun of a lifetim watch him grow up befor our eye watch hi relationship with bartlet blossom as they becom surrog father and son watch hi on and off relationship the first daughter zoey is a joy i enjoy hi snarki from time to time as well in shibboleth he and mr landingham have the follow exchang about the knife gt mr landingham he s veri particular gt gt charli that s one word for it in gone quiet he and bartlet have

staff season 1 6 aid spokeswoman russel campaign season 6 spokeswoman santo campaign season 7 who doesn t love donna there s her kind sweet disposit except the time josh annoy her past her break point she alway ha a warmth about her she alway ha a bright and sunni outlook and alway care for other thi is evid in the way she alway take care of josh on a person level she s often the onli one who can calm him down when he s work up how she wa all worri in the fall s gonna kill you about a satellit fall to earth and potenti hurt peopl how she want a proclam for her teacher mr morello in stir and so on she s also highli intellig compet and resourc she is portray as kind of flaki sometim but i think that s a mirag like in that flashback in in the shadow of two gunmen where donna claim to have had five major and two minor i actual take that to mean she ha a degre of intellectu curios such that she can t decid which subject to stick with thi is a person that didn t have the clear path that pretti much everi other charact on thi list other than charli did she didn t go to or graduat from elit school she had no big career plan none of that to go from where she wa come off the street with no degre or experi to boldli start work for someon who never hire you to scratch and claw and work so hard and get up where did do what she did you can t do that if you re not a highli intellig individu and over the year she becam uber compet at her job and invalu to her superior her girl next door look don t hurt either i think donna had one of the best post sorkin arc and therefor one of the best overal arc of ani charact in term of growth while she wa uber compet at her job over the year she began to feel like she wa outgrow be someon s assist like she want to do more thi becam an underli sourc of tension as i m sure josh at least subconsci wa afraid of lose her in more way than one and thu drag hi feet in term of give her opportun for growth despit do it in littl way like send her to gaza as part of the model so she left him and went out and grew as a person and as a profession befor they final re connect dure the gener elect and she got to end her stori becom the chief of staff to the incom first ladi it s just a satisfi charact arc for a good person who deserv good thing she start as a 20 someth look for her place in the world and end up have found it and then some 7 sam seaborn portray by rob low appear in 80 episod 5 credit onli titl white hous deputi director of commun season 1 4 white hous deputi chief of staff design season 7 the og main charact sam wa a differ breed than than josh and tobi wherea the latter two and even leo went straight into polit sam is the onli one that actual practic law perhap thi is whi he often seem more level head even keel emot adjust than josh and tobi and whi hi style of argument might seem more disciplin wherea josh and tobi use a more impass fieri mode of debat becaus of all of thi sam is perhap more like to to see the bigger pictur in certain case where josh and tobi would be more like to be focus on the trench in the polit fight of the moment they live for the polit fight they fight like their live depend on it sam can certainli get work up when he want to but in gener he s more like to be pragmat to compromis and fight anoth day he doesn t need polit the way they do henc hi decis to practic law instead multipl time i think they also differ in that josh and tobi to quot bartlet want to be the guy the guy depend on sam sometim behav more like he want to eventu be the guy mayb that s whi bartlet said he d be presid someday sam is a great charact easili lovabl but becaus he is as said befor more emot even even keel outwardli kind etc but becaus he is neither a brood cauldron of angst and despair like tobi nor a pressur cooker of feverish restless and intens like josh he is actual just a littl bit less interest than them as a charact 6 dr abigail abbey bartlet portray by stockard chan appear in 57 episod 12 credit onli season 1 7 titl first ladi of the unit state season 1 7 thi will probabl be the most disagre with placement on thi list i can feel your side eye and wtf express abbey is for some reason a polar charact i for one love her she is one half of the most believ coupl i ve ever seen on a tv show and imo her charact elev jed and make him better while at the same time stand as a formid woman a woman to be reckon with in her own right i ve alway thought stockard chan wa magnific in the role some of the best work of her career fulli deserv of the emmi she won for her work in the third season gone quiet dead irish writer she realli sold the charact as a real breath person with her own person her own consider mind her own dream and regret and motiv her own career who made a big sacrific with said career for her husband first by give up her work and then by voluntarili give up her medic licens she ha her own polit her own disappoint her own resent but abov all she love her husband and her children fierc she ha just alway felt like such a real live charact i love the argument between the two of them how they challeng each other whether it s the showdown in the white hous pro am about bartlet handl her the we had a deal spat and everyth surround it in bartlet s third state of the union the war at home or the extend argument in manchest after he decid to run again she can stand up to jed and take him down a peg like no one els can say thing to him that no one els can say becaus when it s just the two of them he s not the presid he s just her husband i think it show a healthi relationship as they don t keep thing insid the duke it out and more often than not they end up make up and move forward that s not to discount the more tender moment they share as you need both the argument and the tender moment to paint a full and realist portrait of thi coupl and thi woman there are mani exampl think of the end of and it s sure to their credit bartlet ha been clear to be intim with hi wife again after the shoot but abbey had punish for make fun of nelli bli so at the episod s conclus he make hi radio address all about histor import women to aton and thi

gt bartlet oh my god you re insan are you you re insan charli or process stori in which she and bartlet are be all play with one anoth on elect night after he s won re elect i could go on but you get the idea she s just a great combin of a woman with her own life work ambit etc a good mother and a love wife who can tear her husband a new one when necessari and show great affect in equal measur she s a complex charact and those are usual the best i will add the caveat that i don t love the season 5 storylin where she temporarili leav jed ani more than the rest of you but i can easili overlook it becaus she is almost uniformli a great charact befor and after that for all the critic sorkin get for not write women well he creat imo two of the best femal televis charact of the last twenti year in abbey and the next charact on the list continu below

1643,"Opening Credits In the opening credits of the show when the names of the actors are revealed, they show a still photograph of the actor and play a snippet of live action from an episode in which the actor appears.

- intelligent thought provoking topics

- a ""grand"" and meaningful foundation

- world building

- strong character development with talented actors

- interesting storylines that make you want to follow them to see where it goes

- humor

- relevance (I'm rewatching season 1 where Bartlett decides whether or not to bomb Syria... hmm... sound familiar?)

like this series does. The West Wing does *all* of the above perfectly. There's just no show like it. Most other political shows seem like cheap knockoffs in comparison (ie. Veep, Madame Secretary, etc) and I had high hopes for House of Cards but even that fell short after season 2.

1679,"Series 2 - ""Don't Tread On Me"" Flags Backstory : I tend to put DVDs on when I am playing video games because I am like that. And today was Series 2 of The West Wing as a backdrop to ""Watchdogs""

When Bartlet is talking in New Hampshire, he is talking in front of a ""Don't Tread On Me"" flag in the hall. It had a long snake on it,

And Sam has a ""Don't Tread On Me"" flag in his office during ""Ellie"" I think (when he is talking to Toby about Seth Gillette).

Given what I think these flags mean, and the speech that Mr Sorkin wrote for Isaac in ""The Six Southern Gentlemen of Tennessee"" (Sports Night) I was wondering if they appeared anywhere else, if he had had a change of heart or if these flags meant something else?

x----x

EDIT : Over night is has been pointed out by two comments that the flags apparently do not mean what they think I mean. My knowledge in this area is (I admit) somewhat sketchy, and I have only ever seen them linked to the Confederate flag - hence my confusion.

Apologies - then - for the suggestion in this, and the confusion in general about why Mr Sorkin had Bartlet speaking in front of one of them (in New Hampshire - which did not strike me as a bastion of The Confederate Army) and why Sam would hang one in his office.

1725,"20 Hours in America - is Josh getting a bad rap? During my rewatch (and subsequent listen to the West Wing Weekly take on it) the consensus seems to be that Donna is completely right in going off on Toby and Josh for their behavior during their ""planes, trains and automobiles"" odyssey.

*""I am not kidding. I have such an impulse to knock your heads together. I can't remember the last time I heard you two talk about anything other than how a campaign was playing in Washington. Cathy needed to take a second job so her dad could be covered by her insurance. She tried to tell you how bad things were for family farmers. You told her we already lost Indiana. You made fun of the fair but you didn't see they have livestock exhibitions and give prizes for the biggest tomato and the best heirloom apple. They're proud of what they grow. Eight modes of transportation, the kindness of six strangers, random conversations with twelve more, and nobody brought up Bartlet versus Ritchie but you. I'm writing letters, on your behalf to the parents of the kids who were killed today. Can I have the table, please?""*

To unpack this, in the opening scene in part 1, Josh seems to be listening to Cathy, while Toby is losing it about President Bartlet's delivery of the speech.  He solicits advice, and is trying to give examples of their struggles.  It's \*Toby\* that says that they were going to lose the state.  Josh didn't hear the bit about Cathy taking a second job for the insurance, because he was in the back of the truck with Cap and Toby.  Yes, he mentioned being briefed about the fair because he was anxious being out of touch, but it wasn't especially dismissive (for Josh, anyway).  And we saw - twice, although Donna only witnessed it once - people say that ""Didn't vote for \[Bartlet\] last time, don't plan on voting for him this time"", and Tyler's friends were also anti-Bartlet, so it wasn't just them talking about the election.  

In the meantime, Josh actually thanks Cathy and Cap, and Tyler.  His point in the running argument with Toby is trying to pay attention to the issues that matter to the voters and not making it about being the smartest kid in the class.  To win, not to beat down Ritchie.  

Yes, Josh does Josh-like things.  He puts his foot squarely in his mouth talking about Cathy to Cap.  He gets pretty racist when he talks about ""Mohammed al Mohammed al Mohammend bin Bizir"".  And apparently he's the reason they had to walk three blocks in the rain (although he did give Donna his coat).  And maybe this was Donna blowing off steam they way Josh and Toby had been all day, but she looks directly at Josh when it was Toby who was the source of most of their frustrations.

Then again, it led to the Matt Kelly scene, which was great and led to a great bit in ""College Kids""",1, 20 hour in america is josh getting a bad rap during my rewatch and subsequent listen to the

1751,"Dropped storylines. I'm doing my first rewatch of the West Wing after previously watching the whole show about ten years ago. Right now, I'm at the end of season 3. 

Everyone knows that Sorkin has a habit of dropping characters out of the blue. During this rewatch, I'm noticing his habit of dropping major storylines too. Or at least wrapping them up *way* too quickly. Allow me to give some examples. 

* The President's MS. The last five episodes of season two focus on the huge fallout it will cause when the world finds out. It ramps you up to expect an enormous fight that lasts a season. But within ten episodes, Bartlet has accepted the censure and any suggestion of repercussions basically end. The story is dropped, and the focus shifts completely to re-election. 

* Leo's addiction. Once again, they make a huge deal about how much of a fight Leo has on his hands. Then they cut a quick deal and the story is dropped. 

* The aftermath of the shooting is time-lapsed in one episode (midterms). I get why this did this from a story point of view, as you can't have Josh recovering for half a season. But it's one of the biggest events in the Bartlet administration, and it's pretty much skipped through. 

Other notable examples include the breakup of Leo's marriage, Sam's relationship with Laurie being exposed, and Josh's PTSD. 

Basically, I'm asking if anyone else has noticed Sorkin's habit of spending more time on the build-up than he does on the event itself? I'm not criticizing the show, by the way. It's just something I never noticed during my first run-through, and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way.

They compare 500 word-essays or whatever and Toby has will stop reading his because Will’s is much better.

To top it all off, will gives toby the letter from sam that says “he’s one of us.” The message is so simple but it almost made me cry because it’s somehow weirdly the best part of sam and toby’s friendship, how despite all their bickering, they’re the only two who truly understand each other, and now will is one of them. Then comes will’s greatest moment where he leaves to go on vacation, then turns right around and asks, “unless you want to start right now?” and toby’s like “yeah.” The scene is perfection from start to finish and i’m obsessed with it.

1765,"“And It’s Sure To Their Credit” (s2e5) - Tribbey and the Dead Flowers EDIT - obviously I meant “surely” up there...

I was looking at an old thread on the scene when Sam fires the two a-holes, and there’s always been a question in my mind about it. The way Tribbey jumps in with his “Oh yes. He can. Now leave here and don’t ever come back.” It seemed so ... strange and out of character for him. His tone of voice was so sarcastic (as it always was). And his most recent interaction with Ainsley was bad - he didn’t have any reason to come around to respecting her like the other staffers did. In fact, she called him out. 

Don’t hate on me for this - I know it doesn’t make total sense - But ever since the first time I saw the episode (when it aired), I’ve been under the impression that TRIBBEY left the dead flowers (not the two guys), and his “leave and never come back” was a cover. As Sam pointed out - no one signed the “Bitch” note. But also - Sam never actually tells them the reason he’s firing them, so they never actually confront him about it, confirm it, or deny it. And Tribbey supposedly has no idea what’s going on - ALL HE KNOWS (unless he knows more, already....) is that Sam is firing them, yet he abruptly jumps in to back him up without hearing anything about the dead flowers.

To me, watching it initially, it seemed so obvious that that was what was happening - That Tribbey left the flowers and found a perfect opportunity to get away with it, because he’s slimy and only cares about drinks with little umbrellas in them (“SHISH KABOB!”) It doesn’t seem like ANYONE else saw it that way, though...?",1, and it s sure to their credit s2e5 tribbey and the dead flower edit obviously i meant surely up there i wa looking at an old thread on the scene when sam fire the two a hole and there s always been a question in my mind about it the way tribbey jump in with his oh yes he can now leave here and don t ever come back it seemed so strange and out of character for him his tone of voice wa so sarcastic a it always wa and his most recent interaction with ainsley wa bad he didn t have any reason to come around to respecting her like the other staffer did in fact she called him out don t hate on me for this i know it doesn t make total sense but ever since the first time i saw the episode when it aired i ve been under the impression that tribbey left the dead flower not the two guy and his leave and never come back wa a cover a sam pointed out no one signed the bitch note but also sam never actually tell them the reason he s firing them so they never actually confront him about it confirm it or deny it and tribbey supposedly ha no idea what s going on all he know unless he know more already is that sam is firing them yet he abruptly jump in to back him up without hearing anything about the dead flower to me watching it initially it seemed so obvious that that wa what wa happening that tribbey left the flower and found a perfect opportunity to get away with it because he s slimy and only care about drink with little umbrella in them shish kabob it doesn t seem like anyone else saw it that way though, and it s sure to their credit s2e5 tribbey and the dead flower edit obvious i meant sure up there i wa look at an old thread on the scene when sam fire the two a hole and there s alway been a question in my mind about it the way tribbey jump in with hi oh ye he can now leav here and don t ever come back it seem so strang and out of charact for him hi tone of voic wa so sarcast as it alway wa and hi most recent interact with ainsley wa bad he didn t have ani reason to come around to respect her like the other staffer did in fact she call him out don t hate on me for thi i know it doesn t make total sens but ever sinc the first time i saw the episod when it air i ve been under the impress that tribbey left the dead flower not the two guy and hi leav and never come back wa a cover as sam point out no one sign the bitch note but also sam never actual tell them the reason he s fire them so they never actual confront him about it confirm it or deni it and tribbey supposedli ha no idea what s go on all he know unless he know more alreadi is that sam is fire them yet he abruptli jump in to back him up without hear anyth about the dead flower to me watch it initi it seem so obviou that that wa what wa happen that tribbey left the flower and found a perfect opportun to get away with it becaus he s slimi and onli care about drink with littl umbrella in them shish kabob it doesn t seem like anyon els saw it that way though

1768,"Is Cliff Calley a good guy? I've been trying to listen to the West Wing Weekly episodes as close to concurrent as I can (watching episodes at night, listening to the episodes at work the next day) and I found Josh Malina's take in the episode for [H. Con-172](http://thewestwingweekly.com/episodes/310) , on Cliff ""helping"" Leo, to be interesting.  Cliff talks about waiting in the ""tall weeds"" for Gibson if he went after Leo in the hearing., but Malina suggests this is a way to save a bargaining chip for later, and that Cliff isn't a good guy at all.

My original take was more like Hrishi's in the episode, that Cliff is a good guy and is trying to make this go away.  But now I wonder if the truth is in the middle.  Going after Leo might have scored a few immediate political points, but would also make, as Cliff said, ""good people hate"" the Republicans.  If the end goal was always to censure the President, then it makes sense that Calley would try to use the threat of Leo's exposure to facilitate that end.   Especially if they knew what Ainsley found out, that the Administration was full of good, righteous people, and specifically what Cliff may have known from reading Donna's diary that no one actually knew.  Calley may have understood prolonged hearings would damage the Republicans even as it did in real life with the Clinton impeachment hearings.

This darker take might be the only way Joe Quincy is able to say what he did about Josh's PTSD connection to music - that it had been in Donna's diary and Calley let it drop at some point.  

I'm still inclined to think Cliff isn't a really bad guy, not nearly the person Josh Malina paints him to be, but I can see him being a bit more calculating that I originally thought.  I do think he had genuine affection for Donna, tho'.

1772,"Finished first watch Just finished the season finale yesterday (well technically today at like 3am) and after I finished it, I just felt kinda empty. But now that I’ve had time to process it, I am feeling all of the emotions: happy, sad, overwhelmed. It was so bittersweet. 

I could spend a while talking about the finale, but I’ll just talk about my two favorite parts: Donna looking around her new office as Chief of Staff, and CJ leaving the White House. Those were both really amazing moments for me. Watching Donna grow as a person and work her way up to higher positions was one of my favorite storylines, and the look on CJs face when she told the man she didn’t work at the White House and walked away was satisfying. CJ was the first character that I liked and the only character that I’ve consistently liked through all 7 seasons. I’m so glad she ended up happy doing what she wanted to do. Oh, and Bartlet giving Charlie the constitution. That made me actually cry. 

With that being said, I wish the original group all had one last goodbye together in the Oval Office or something. Might’ve been cheesy, but I still would’ve wanted it. 

Starting this show, I wasn’t sure what to expect. You hear a show is critically acclaimed and think, “ok, this show has got a lot of praise from people. I’ll probably like it.”  This critically acclaimed show puts other critically acclaimed shows to shame. (Seriously, some shows should not be considered critically acclaimed.) I know a lot of people love this show because it gives them hope or it’s an escape from reality, and while that was true for me as well, what really got me hooked right away was the dialogue and acting. The dialogue is something else, like nothing I’ve seen in any other show. The acting was superb. I figured Martin Sheen and Allison Janney would be great since I’d seen their work before, but since I had never heard of anyone else I wasn’t sure what to expect of them. They didn’t disappoint either, especially Richard Schiff.  

While Sorkin’s era of this show was superior, I was so glad, and pleasantly surprised, that I still enjoyed s5-7 enough to keep watching.  I was scared I wouldn’t like it because of all the horrible reviews about s5 (unpopular opinion: it wasn’t that bad.)

This is a show I knew I would rewatch many times before I even finished it. I wanna rewatch it now, I’m already going through withdrawals, but I have some questions: should take a break before I rewatch it, or watch another Sorkin show?

1782,"My idea for a 'West Wing' revival First off, I don't think it should be called the West Wing. We've seen the inside of a fictionalized White House for seven seasons, and it's unlikely (unless they want to take the perspective of a conservative staff) that there would be so many consecutive or near-consecutive terms of Democrats in the White House.    The new show should be called ""The Beltway.""

Second, while I would love for the old cast to have a role to play, the show cannot focus on them. At least not all of them.  A strong new cast of diverse actors/actresses need to be the center of the show.

As a reflection on our current times, the president occupying the White House is a Trump-like figure... maybe not to the same degree of incompetence and corruption (personal opinion), but in terms of a fascination with social media and waging a war on ""fake news.""

Modeling our present circumstances, Democrats have just gained the majority in the House and have voted Congresswoman CJ Craig to be the Speaker of the House. She ran for congress shortly after the flash-forward from the end of the series after the opening of Bartlet's presidential library reminded her of the impact policy-makers can have versus that of the private sector.   Donna Lyman is the head of the DNC and is struggling to maintain peace between establishment and populist factions within the party.   Charlie Young is a rising star in politics and is a freshman member of the House. He represents a more liberal side of the party and tends to clash occasionally with CJ over her more moderate approach/agenda.  Ainsley Hays is the current president's chief of staff - trying everything in her power to keep some order in the West Wing.   Sam Seaborn and Josh Lyman run a major DC consulting firm.  Their firm is contracted to run a team that will coordinate communication and strategy between the party institutions (DNC/DCCC/House/Senate) - the members of which will make up the new cast of the show.

One of many problems with this concept is that you can't  possibly match the stakes surrounding events that take place in the White House.  Several compelling episodes of the West Wing involved major national security events that directly involved the president.  Of course, nothing stops the show from eventually transitioning into a CJ Craig White House with several former associates brought in to run her staff.

Thoughts?

Securing peace and sustaining hope In this winter of anxiety in fear ...

More than anytime in recent history Americas destiny is not of our own choosing.  We did not seek nor did we provoke an assault on our freedom on our way of life.  We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil.  Yet the true measure of a people’s strength is how they rise to master that moment when it does arrive.  44 people were killed a couple of hours ago at Kennison State  University.  3 swimmers from the men’s team were killed and 2 others are in critical condition when after having heard the explosion from their own practice facility they ran into the fire to help get people out ... RAN INTO THE FIRE...  

The streets of heaven are too crowded with angels tonight.  They’re our students, and our teachers, and our parents, and our friends.  THE STREETS OF HEAVEN ARE TOO CROWDED WITH ANGELS.  But that every time we think we’ve measured our capacity to meet a challenge we look up and we’re reminded that that capacity may well be limit-less.  

This is a time for American hero’s. We will do what is hard.  We will achieve what is great. THIS IS A TIME FOR AMERICAN HEROES and we reach for the stars.  God bless their memory, God bless you and God bless these United States of America.

The next scene is of President Bartlet and Abbie staring out of what is presumably Marine One’s window down at the field Zoey is located in. So the first part of my question is regarding the 25th. If Barlet had “Stepped Down” by invoking the 25th and we don’t see him re-sign the second letter until a couple scenes later, then how are they on Marine One without President Walken when they rescue Zoey?

1787,"S7 E18: Requiem Ok so I actually didn’t cry in this episode. I’m shocked. 

I like how they were able to bring back so many guest stars, even if it was only for the funeral scene. Personally, I never really liked Amy, so I thought her scenes were a waste. I would’ve rather had her scenes be replaced with Ainsley. 

I’m kinda surprised that his funeral wasn’t held in the Washington National Cathedral like Mrs. Landingham’s. 

Charlie being shocked that Josh hadn’t offered Donna a job yet was great, but also not suprising, cause it’s Josh.  He better offer her a job. 

I loved the scene where Jed told the story about Margaret using a trash can as an umbrella for Leo and accidentally dumping food all over him. I also loved when they all went back up to the residence and shared stories about Leo. It was cute and funny and you could see that they were all deeply touched by him. It was just awkward to see Abbey look so uncomfortable when he was telling the stories. 

It must’ve been really surreal and sad for the cast to have buried John Spencer in real life, and then film an episode where they buried his character. Like I said in my last post, there was probably no need to dig up emotions. 

When I first started the show Leo was one of my favorites. It sad John Spencer couldn’t be around to finish this great series and see how it ended.

Here goes:

We see a young woman in her late teens/early twenties.  Abruptly slamming her laptop shut, barely getting it into her backpack before she runs into a rainy DC. We see a tracking shot of her running out of a building near the national mall.

Cut to a large office building where we find Donna Moss, in a conference room with a large Santos Foundation logo and a table covered in paperwork. A TV is on tuned to MSNBC with her old boss Josh Lyman interviewed.

She unmutes:
 “... Nothing is worse than this. I can’t imagine an administration caught lying about something this crucial...”

The phone rings. She pauses the tv and hits her speakerphone. 
“Donna.”
“President Bartlet, is everything okay?”
“Everything’s fine Donna. Listen, in the next 15 minutes you’re gonna have a young woman showing up at your door.”
“Okay...”
“Hey Donna, you’re running for Congress?”
“Well Mr. President, I’m not sure I...”
“You should, and you should be sure about it!”
“Well thank your sir. I’m definitely considering my options.”
“Good. Good.”
“Um... Mr. President....This young woman?”
“Donna, she’s something special. I’ve been keeping an eye on her since... I guess, since she was born.”

A ruckus is heard at the front of the office. An employee approaches and tries to explain before Donna cuts her off.

“Let her in.”
A few seconds later see the young woman from before, now soaking wet:
“Donna, say hello to Cory Tolliver.”
“Thank you Mr. President. Hello Ms. Moss.”
“Donna, do yourself a favor and hire her.”
“Yes, Mr. President.”
The call disconnects as the two women stare at each other, trying to figure out what just happened.”

A few seconds pass, when Donna realizes.

“Ms. Tolliver, let’s take a walk.”

We flash forward to a walk and talk a couple of years later. Cory is now an assistant to Congresswoman Moss... we eventually weave story lines with original cast members and where they ended up in politics after the end of the original run and we see new story lines about current and past political events including Cory’s father Morris Tolliver’s death and the way she was raised (and mentored by the Bartlet family) and we learn her political motivations. 

This is Donna and Cory’s story now. How they can make it to The West Wing, and what happens once they make it there.

1794,"S7 E14: How much personal information should a candidate share with the public? Regarding the Santos briefcase storyline. Bruno finds Santos’ briefcase in a meeting room and tells Vinick about its contents, which contain monthly checks written to a woman with a 7 year old child. It’s assumed Santos has an illegitimate child but it turns out to be his brother’s child, and Santos stepped up and decided to pay the child support for him. At the end of the episode when Vinick gives Santos back his briefcase, he tells Santos that this information will get out and that the public deserves to know the truth. Which begs my question: How much personal information should a presidential candidate share to the public? Do they have obligation to tell the public every detail of their personal life? Personally, I don’t think Santos should tell, not only because it would cause a scandal and make him look bad, but because it’s really none of the public’s business, and, unlike Bartlet’s MS, wouldn’t directly affect his ability to do his job.

1821,"I'm having the weirdest experience post another rewatch. I've had lots of hospital and home bed time recently so I got a VPN that gets me American Netflix and rewatched TWW for the Million-Gajillion^th time.   

I finished it really quickly (again) and felt that hollowness that you get once you finish so I decided to watch another presidential type show to keep me (kind of) in the white house zone.    

For some reason I decided to watch Designated survivor. Although it's kind of....a bit shit... I think the story idea of it is fantastic, I only wish sorkin wrote the plot.    

One thing that annoys me is the utter disregard the show has for proper white house procedure and unrealistic presidential priorities (like not even think about naming a VP immedi after the explosion), or the secret service allowing the president to slip away ""from the office"" with only one secret service agent to watch his estranged son play the violin etc.....

But what annoys me the most, is that it stole some of sorkins lines and ideas. They were poorly executed but still... I don't think it's very fair...or maybe it is, after all good writers borrow from other writers, great writers steal from them outright.    

I have to be truthful with what I'm saying so although the show winds me up, I can't stop watching it for the cheesey conspiracy involved.   

It's like the west wing is some relatively unknown jazz band from the 50s who pioneered many forms of jazz that evolved into other, more modern genres and Designated survivor is a cheesey pop Club tune that has no depth or substance but you can't help agreeing is catchy, I'm really annoyed with myself but also enjoying, hence the weird experience.

1836,"a moveable feast - the loves of Sam Seaborn Rob Lowe was supposed to be the focus of *The West Wing.*  He's the first of the staff we meet in the pilot.  In the spirit of the relationship threads for Josh and C.J., I'd like to propose a discussion of his love life.  He was engaged when he joins the Bartlet Team, and he's engaged when he joins the Santos Administration, but I think this is really a two horse race with two women he doesn't (seem to) end up with.

5. Lisa Sherborne - writer for Vanity Fair, the ex-fiancée.  You can see flashes of what might have been there during ""100,000 Airplanes"", but Sam says that she didn't like him very much.

4. Unnamed Fiancée - Nothing really to go on.  We know she's a lawyer, we know she seems to be OK with him taking the Deputy CoS job.  So apparently they talk, which would rank her ahead of Lisa.

3. Laurie - I don't care for the Laurie subplot, but the writers did show that two cared for one another.  It might be interesting if she somehow ended up being the unnamed fiancée, but that's unlikely.  Her former profession would be an albatross around the neck of both Sam and the administration.

2. Mallory O'Brien - This was hard.  I love Sam &amp; Mallory.  Allison Smith was great and had great chemistry with Rob Lowe.  Ultimately, I think it was doomed.  She never seemed to get the life of devotion required, even when the President and Leo tried to explain it to her.  She would have left Sam just like her mother left Leo.  But it would've been fun for a while.

1. Ainsley Hayes - It's a shame Emily Procter got the *CSI:Miami* gig.  She and Lowe were dynamite together, and Ainsley brought a different dynamic to the show, and might have been a great venue to explore conservative viewpoints.  It would have been interesting in the mythical season 8 how they would've dealt with her and Sam, because the sparks would keep flying. 

special mention - Josh Lyman.  I don't personally see Sam or Josh as gay or bi, but I've seen the theory online, and I don't think people are pulling it out of thin air.  Josh is singularly unimpressed - both times - to hear his supposed best friend is engaged.

1845,"John Spencer and his life long influence on my politics Wargames was the first film I ever saw John Spencer in. And I didn’t know who he was at the time - it would be nearly 15 years before I saw him in The West Wing, and realise just how exceptional he was as an actor.

But weirdly, it was in this role that he left a lasting impression on me, because he refused to start World War III without knowing why. Without knowing if it was real, why they were doing it, why they were killing millions of people.

WarGames is a truly phenomenal movie for so many reasons and this is definitely one of them.

She's cruel to Toby, but she's not wrong.

But I noticed something this rewatch - when they're outside of the house in Commencement, when Toby says he scraped together for the down payment by selling his soul, he offers his hand, and Andy takes it as he leads her into the house.

If I were watching this for the first time, there's a chance one would think of that moment ""Oh my god, she could say yes"". Then I realise that's never going to happen, and I'm heartbroken all over again.

1858,"We talk about Toby towards the end of the series, but what about Bartlett? I've mentioned (as if anyone's paying attention to my posts) that I'm on rewatch number a lot and I'm honing in a lot more on individual characters and their arcs. Obviously the Sorkin changeover is a big one, so I'm curious what others think of the end of season 5, start of season 6 Bartlet. I feel like he's relying more on Kate Harper than he would have leaned on her superior (McNally) and I feel like Jed wouldn't have ever let Leo feel he wasn't valued or listened to. Feels almost as large as Toby's change— 

Curious what others think. I kind of get it: he's becoming more invested in the idea of a legacy, and that's nothing to scoff at, but that whole arc seems odd to me in many ways.

That said, Chiefs of Staff come and go in real life, so maybe not too surprising (minus the wholly strange choice of a replacement). 

Curious to read thoughts!

1859,"Reboot idea I have given it proper thought and come up with the only possible/best reboot idea. If this happens I do expect the credit!

....President Santos has completed his two terms. A republican ( Trump type) has been elected and we are some time into their presidency. Upset with our country's current state of affairs, powers within the Democratic party meet to decide how to move forward. This way much of the cast is reunited. However, they disagree on who to run in the next elections. Factions are created and we watch as they pit candidates against each other to be the Democratic nominee. The season will also show the republican White House as it scrambles to prepare for the upcoming fight. My vote is Seaborn for presidency. I imagine Toby's wife also running and later becoming his vice. CJ will represent big donors. Ex presidents will provide wisdom. And Josh will be roped in by Sam begrudgingly for one final run.

Plus, I always felt he thought he was better than her and couldn't shake it.    They always seemed like high school sweethearts but with Josh, he was always focused in his career.  They probably could have had a couple of good years, Josh divorces her because he is too focused on work.
3. Amy Gardner - she is fun and devious at the same time.  It is off and on for several years.  Maybe they get married and have kids.  She eventually divorces him in some public scandal but it is actually a conspiracy started by Amy and Josh has to rebuild up his career.

I don't knows, I always saw these connections in this way with Joey as the front-runner.

Edit: How about this for a thought experiment.  Josh marries Amy, they end up in a messy divorce and scandal.   He rebounds back to Donna.  Donna feels neglected, eventually divorces Josh.

1895,"Watch Through Question—Bingo Bob Finished a watch through of Season 5 and I’ve been thinking about President Bartlet nominating Russell for VP. The first choice was Sec. Berryhill until the Speaker made it clear that Congress wouldn’t confirm him. It always seemed to me that Russell was a strange choice because no one really wanted him, including the President. It was such a passive choice, almost as if the administration gave up. This was an important appointment given the President’s health concern and it essentially elevated a no name congressman to the national stage. I seem to remember that after President Bartlet told Leo that Russell would be the nominee, he was visibly frustrated and didn’t even bother telling the staff. He just went off to bed.

Anyone else think this was out of character for the President, Leo, Toby, Josh, etc.? Seems like they bent over backwards to please the Republicans for something as important as the VP.

Edit: I know that Russell’s name was on the list of “suggested nominees”. I just can’t believe they actually chose a name on the Speaker’s list.

1898,"Josh as Chief of Staff I just finished my second watch through of TWW, and I'm finding it hard to see Josh succeeding as Chief of Staff.  

I prefer the headcanon that Leo gave C.J.'s name to President Bartlet over Josh's because he needed Josh out on the campaign trail finding a successor, but I feel the skill set we're presented for Josh doesn't seem to translate to the next level.  He's got the knowledge of domestic issues, certainly, and he's generally absorbed the right procedure for things, but he's never been in the Situation Room and he thinks of Italy as the ""one that looks like a boot"".  

What's worse, we never see Josh being good with people, particularly from a leadership standpoint.  His complete flub of the rally &amp; thank the troops moment in ""Election Day"" would concern me greatly.  There's no sense that any of his staff will have anything close to the loyalty that Leo enjoyed.  He has Sam, and then has has people like Amy &amp; Lou who he's had to fight more than he's worked with.

I keep coming back to the advice Bartlet gave Secretary Tribbey during the State of the Union, when he was ""the guy"" - that your Chief of Staff should be your best friend, and that isn't Josh for Matt Santos.  They go head to head on most issues, and with Kazakhstan possibly derailing the first 100 days, I can only see that tension increasing.

I also feel the loss of Leo was never fully explored for Josh.  Going back to Donna's comments to Amy in ""Commencement"", about his biggest fear being losing people he loves and it being his fault, this is another huge hit to his mental health.  His deterioration during ""Transition"" could even been looked at as a PTSD relapse, with his explosion at Otto somewhat equivalent to putting his hand through the glass.  (Which makes me wonder about Donna and her lying to Santos - she had to know that Josh had never been this bad, right?  Was she downplaying his status so Santos wouldn't think he couldn't do the job or did she literally not see how bad he was - was it that she didn't want to see it?)

1924,"Couple of random questions after watching again I watched the show again and these questions are getting to me.  They are kind of random and focus on last seasons.

\- In the later seasons, I was really confused between the role of Hoynes and Russell (they looked so much alike).  Anyway, what did Will do during that time.  Did  he work for the President, both Vice Presidents.  Sometimes at the same time?   How was he able to get so much access with the President's staff when he was working for the Vice President?

\- Harper was  Deputy National Security Advisor ?, she seemed to have a lot of influence when in the situation room.  Is this normal in real life?    Also, she seemed kind of young  to be a commander and Deputy NSA advisor, could that happen?

\- What is the role of White House Counsel?  Especially towards the end with the leak.  I guess to protect the White House.  But what if something in the White House violates the law, do they have to keep silent or does the counsel have to report the illegality?     There is one scene with a WH leaker, does the leaker have to cooperate with White House counsel at all?

\- What happened to Zoe after she was captured.  There were a lot of holes there.  They could have done several episodes just going over the timeline of the capture and afterwards.

Random thoughts on the show, there were good episodes and better episodes.   Josh was amazing and hilarious in every episode, I can't think of a bad Josh scene.  He saved season 6 and 7.    Bartlett wasn't hilarious but loved when he was on the soap box.    For the me the best scenes were the serious ones with the situation room.

1930,"Discussion: Season 7, episode 7 - ""The Debate"" I watched today the debate episode and have mixed opinions about it. So I will try to list some points and them we discuss:

* With the exception of seconds of background before they entered in the stage the entire episode was shot as a real televised debate. Seems strange to me this choice of Alex Graves because on all the seasons we see the opposite: a lot of background and very little of the debates, speeches and interviews aired. We never got to watch Zoey entire interview after being kidnapped or the President and the First Lady disclosing the MS in the interview.

* The writing of Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr. in this episode is inconstant. I love the dialogues, researched arguments  defended well, a lot of quips and insights. But the whole premise fails to me, I couldn't believe that the moderator would be so willing to forget the rules and also do no understand the reason Vinick would do something so boldy without consulting Sheila.

* Matt interrupts a lot Vinick. And the moderator only accepted the changes in the debate if he could control both candidates. I thought the moderator was too weak.

* Jimmy Smits was great, but Alan Alda absolutely stoled this episode. He was incredible, his character was very real and I really enjoyed his perfomance.

What do you think about this episode? I would love to hear more opinions.

1932,"Am I the only one who doesn't like season 3? I'm almost finished with my first run-through of the series (just started season seven today). Seasons 1-2 are my favorites, season 4 is okay, season 5 was boring, and I'm actually enjoying seasons 6-7 (the campaign angle gave the series a breath of fresh air, I thought). But the one season that I really did not like was season 3.

Ignoring the two special episodes (which I do) the season just didn't live up to my expectations. We ended season two with Bartlet pausing before he answered the reelection question, and then season three begins with everything seemingly all over the place. The whole ""did Bartlet lie about his MS plot?"" would have been good if it didn't end as abruptly as it did (I thought the way it ended was such a cop-out, too). New characters Babish and Bruno I just could not stand - Bruno got on my nerves all the time (though part of me thinks that was the point) and there was something about Babish I didn't like. Funnily enough, I actually don't mind them in season 7 (probably because we don't see them as often). And truthfully, I can barely remember any episodes from the season.

1938,"John Wells and his crew fundamentally misunderstood The West Wing I've posted here before about how I've really [had trouble with season 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/61wyln/season_5/). Listening to The West Wing Weekly's episode on 'Memorial' helped me get to an epiphany about why. Josh and Hrishi to their credit enjoyed season 5 and were quite even handed with their comments. At one point they mentioned how Season 5 has been lacking 'Deus Ex Machina' resolutions that Aaron Sorkin would use. During that section they also commented that Sorkin's West Wing was a ""fairy tale"" and how John Wells' version was not.

I agree entirely and that, in my opinion, is the problem.

John Wells decided to give us just another TV show where the characters squabble and their ideals are crushed by the burdens of everyday life. Sorkin gave us an idealistic show that showed the absolute best that motivated people could achieve. Yes, it was light-hearted and showed unlikely situations like conflicts between the POTUS and CoS resolving overnight. 

But that's what made it wonderful.

It wasn't the depressing drudgery that politics can sometimes be. Even in loss, Sorkin's White House maintained its composure and plowed ahead while Wells' ruminates in the juices of its disappointment. It's just not the show that hooked me. Yes, the fact that POTUS and Leo are best of friends through thick and thin with no prolonged arguments is unrealistic. But that is what made the show special. It showed us what could be and what we can aspire to. ""A more perfect life"" if you will. It's inspiring.

No surprise then that some of the best moments in season 5 are the ones with the deus ex machinas like the Republican caucus delaying long enough for the President to walk away, scoring him a political win. Or Josh coming up with the genius solution of placing two justices from ideologically opposite ends of the spectrum (who are conveniently already good friends).

Let's be honest, Wells' West Wing is still far superior to 99% of other TV but it misses why people enjoyed the show that came before it.

So the season three opener. The first episode after 9/11. I sort of knew something like this was coming, bc of the time period, I just really wasn’t expecting it to be... this. The conversation Josh, Toby, Sam and CJ have with those high school kids in the mess, is perhaps, one of my favourite scenes of the episode. It’s not only the topics — Sam talking about terrorism’s failure rate, Josh’s SAT inspired question for those students, Toby talking about his Dad’s friend who was praying, CJ discussing the intelligence community — but the imagery of these four insanely smart, powerful political figures who literally got a President elected giving this impromptu forum to the next generation? And the juxtaposed with Leo’s questioning, being brutal and bitter and moderately prejudiced?

I’ve read reviews that say this episode was preachy and pointless and it didn’t plain work after the S2 finale but ya know what? I think it does. I think putting this in an episode where the characters are all incredibly liberal, and still showing their divergent, complex, confusing beliefs in a form and questioning setting — I think that works. I think it sends the message that just because you’re right on some things, doesn’t mean you’re right on all things.

1943,"What was President Bartlett's unofficial policy with the press on issues involving his daughters? (Specific Reference) It's been a while since I've watched the West Wing. I seem to remember a scene in which President Bartlett got super pissed off at a member of the Press Corp that was asking personal questions about his daughters/ approached his daughter with questions without asking the administration officially. 

If I recall correctly, Josiah has this journalists ""Press Credentials"" pulled, though I believe it was done through unofficial channels with the network/ newspaper the guy worked for. This, in turn led to the network/ newspaper replacing the previous journalist with one that was much more critical of the Bartlett Administration. 

Am I mixing up shows? What episode was this in? With the whole Acosta thing going on right now, it reminded me of this so I was hoping to go back and find the episode, but I can't find it and I don't have time to watch the entire series again.

Two politicians are brought into one of the meeting rooms in the West Wing. One is a Republican, the other a Democrat. They quip at each other something like ""You think I'm a bleeding heart liberal who wants to raise taxes"" and the other says something like ""And you think I'm a heartless flag-waving conservative"". Then one says ""but there is one thing we agree on..."" and then they both say the same thing and grin at each other. I have a feeling it was campaign finance reform, but I can't remember exactly.
