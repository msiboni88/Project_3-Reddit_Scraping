0,"A long time ago I posted my (incomplete) West Wing floor plan that I created from DVD special features. I'm back at it and updating to reflect all the set changes I can find! [My original post, six years ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/11277o/my_west_wing_map_stitched_together_from/)

Years ago I started a little passion project of trying to reconstruct a floor plan of the set of The West Wing from screencaps I took off the DVD special feature tour of the set. A recent rewatch of the series sparked my drive to start working on cleaning it up some more in Photoshop and adding to it. The set was built with doors galore and lots of extra space that could get used for future changes, and it's fun to see different little areas appear and evolve throughout the series. The most obvious is the creation of a whole press bullpen area for season 5, but there's other interesting things like the fact that they finally showed where at least one bathroom is in season 5, too. I just wanted to share my progress and maybe start some interesting conversations about what the reddit WW community thinks of the way the set evolved over the years.

EDIT 2: I realized I misspelled ‚Äúcolonnade.‚Äù I‚Äôll fix it at some point."
1,"The ending to ""S1:11: Lord John Marbury"" Gosh, I literally never post on here, and have seen this episode dozens of times and it always gives me chills. Sorkin's ability to have his characters quote the bible in a way that relates to the plot without shoving religion down your throat is just... impressive. And the actual quote is scary while simultaneously being fascinating &amp; ominous. And the way His Lordship comes off as a cartoon &amp; yet is able to truly flex his intelligence to counter-balance it makes him such a fun, well-written, dynamic character. But the timing, oh man the timing further sets the entire scene, just the way the lighter lands in his hand from an off-screen Bartlet after His Lordship asks for it again, as well as it fading to black while hearing the lighter go off; man, this scene is a wonder.  


But I've never, \*ever\*, noticed Leo quietly laughing in the background! And boy oh boy, that sure brought me so much joy. Because damn, Lord John Marbury is just the coolest &amp; just enough ridiculous. That's all. I just had to tell someone that &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"

5,"I‚Äôm Marion Cotesworth-Haye! Jesus why is this funnier than I remember?

 I don‚Äôt even find it *that* funny when Marion Coatsworth Haye introduces herself, it‚Äôs when CJ bursts out laughing afterwards is when I lose it. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I was...I was thinking of this thing from...this thing that just happened with the deficit.‚Äù 

Her voice on the word ‚Äòdeficit‚Äô kills me. Honestly just made my night better üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
6,"What to watch after The West Wing I've just completed my 5th rewatching of the full series of The West Wing. We also recently watched The Newsroom and Studio 60. Have watched Sportsnight previously as well, so I'm looking for options outside the Sorkin-verse. 

What should I watch next? I need something to satisfy my need for a top-quality political drama. 

I've seen House of Cards and thought that was good (especially early seasons) in a very different way obviously. 

Considering:

1. Designated Survivor - saw a few episodes on ABC early on and thought the writing wasn't great.  Does it get better?

2. Scandal - haven't seen a minute of it. Is it too much soap opera?

Any other suggestions?"
7,"Did anyone else wonder if Trump had a ""wrong speech in the teleprompter"" moment like when Will and Toby write their mocking speech in for Russell's inauguration? Season 5, episode 4, Will and Toby are having a hard time writing for an uninspiring VP choice, and write a speech mocking him. It accidentally goes on the prompter and Pres Bartlet has to wing it on the spot. 

&amp;#x200B;

July 4th Trump talks about airports and jets in the American War of Independence, the internet goes wild with memes. Was one of his own speechwriters mocking him and forgot to switch out? (Likely he was just rambling off prompter, but this way is more fun to imagine)."
8,"iTunes $29.99 Complete Series Deal iTunes has the West Wing complete series for $29.99. This is the lowest price I have ever seen for all of the episodes. 
I‚Äôm pulling the trigger before West Wing goes the way of The Office on Netflix."
9,"What moment or eppisode sticks with you the most? This show is full of quotes, moments, and just great life lessons ( good and bad). It was the first show that ever made me cry ( leo's death, actually john spencer but when they did it on screen that just hit me), the first show to make me believe in something ( that the government can actually function if they try) and the first show to make me realize how the world kinda works( the government doesn't really try, they just bicker) 

&amp;#x200B;

Random things stick with me, but what stays with you? Is there a WW quote or storyline that rattles around in your head? Maybe just something you remember once in a while that makes you happy."

12,Will Bailey really went from the man of ideals and willing to run a dead man to prove points to going the safe route with Russell and getting burnt. He went from a great character that I loved to just being a nuisance. What happened over 4 years to make him basically a 180 as a character? 
13,"What are the two best episodes of the West Wing to get them hooked? For our nation's 243rd birthday, I will be showing my friend this show, but we will only have enough time for two episodes. I am just not sure which episodes would be best. I am thinking Galileo 5 and Mr. Willis of Ohio, thoughts?"

16,"Sam Seaborn for President Rewatching in Netflix. 

I'm sure it's been brought up (many times). In season 3, episode 15, 'Hartsfield's Landing' Bartlett tells Sam he'll be president some day. Any ideas on why we haven't had a West Wing reboot with Rob Lowe as president? With so many shows being brought back, why not?"
17,"...this country is an idea, and one that's lit the world for two centuries and treason against that idea is not just a crime against the living! This ground holds the graves of people who died for it, who gave what Lincoln called the last full measure of devotion, of fidelity. "

19,"Happy Canada Day, Donna! "
20,Close enough. I wonder if Martin Sheen gave Bradley Whitford some tips? 
21,"Just watched Election Day part 2 S7, E17.

I teared up a bit when they found Leo. I can't imagine how the actors and crew dealt with the real life death of John Spencer and then had to act in that script. 

I know TWWW hasn't quite made it to this episode yet, but does anyone know of any material describing how they decided to write this, and how the cast and crew handled it?  

I had trouble thinking of Leo's last on-screen appearance and felt ashamed for not remembering.

There are a few episodes that tug at my heartstrings, but I was truly saddened to know such a great actor left us too soon, with at least one story only partially told."
22,"West Wing ruined me for other shows Mostly, because  the show is so great.  But also because I can‚Äôt take the actors seriously when they are in other roles, because they will always be the WW character. 

Example. I watched Parks and Rec before WW... and during a rewatch tonight, I just can‚Äôt take Rob Lowe seriously as Chris Treager üòÇüòÇ"
23,"Question about the convention 6x22 I never understood how in the fuck Baker managed to mess everything up the way he did. Like he literally came out of nowhere (after deciding not to run) and took a big chunk of delegates and seemed likely to be the nominee. Causing nothing but damage especially after the depression story about his wife came out so I have a few questions 


Q1: how the fuck did he manage to do that and why did the delegates even have faith that he was the man needed to be the delegate?

Q2: Would a candidate realistically be able to do that? The convention was already a mess and baker seemed to have caused even more damage.

Q3: Baker seemed untrustworthy in my eyes after he pulled that stunt, why would santo‚Äôs trust him for VP?

Q4: it seemed clear from the start that he didn‚Äôt stand a chance against vinick either, why tf didn‚Äôt Leo step in and tell him to buzz off like he did with santos?"

28,Question about A Constituency of One This is the episode where it is Josh‚Äôs birthday. It is also where Josh chases Senator Carrick away from the Democratic Party. Here is my question. Is Carrick stumping for the same anti-ICBM system that Leo is touting in Season 1? Why are Leo and Josh suddenly so against it?  Did Sir Joh Marbury make an exceptional argument to sway them?
29,"Why is S6E2 called ""Birnam Wood""? I understand the reference is from MacBeth and the prophecy of how MacBeth will die when Birnam Wood comes to him. But I don't see how it relates to the story in the episode."
30,"Juxtaposition Just started a West Wing rewatch and got to the first scene with Josh and Zoey.  A delightful moment in the kitchen with a pot of chili and a fascinating juxtaposition with their interactions in Handmaid's Tale.  I tried to find it on Youtube but the best I could get was the bar scene in the next episode. ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3vW1X4HlNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3vW1X4HlNU))   Still, I recommend watching Eps. 1:5 and 1:6 if you need a respite from delicious depression of the scenes with Commander Lawrence and June."

37,"The Musical Detail in ‚ÄúThe Warfare of Genghis Khan‚Äù (S5:E13) I don‚Äôt know if anyone has appreciated this yet but there is a cool little ‚ÄúEaster egg‚Äù of sorts in the episode where Josh is at odds with the NASA ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù (as Donna calls them). In a scene towards the end of the ep, Josh is seen lounging in his apartment until there is a knock at the door where a NASA scientist has left him a telescope. The background noise is the song ‚ÄúDark was the Night, Cold Was the Ground‚Äù by Blind Willie Johnson. The significance of this song is that it was included on the Voyager Golden Record, a disc sent into space by NASA in the hopes that it would be recovered and researched by extraterrestrials. The Record includes many images, songs, and symbols that help to explain the Earth and mankind. These little details make the show that much more enjoyable!"

42,"Help finding a specific episode: retaliatory attack Since last week's real-life events (called-off retaliation attack on Iran), I've been trying to remember the exact episode in which a retaliation attack is weighed and someone (Bartlet?) is musing over the fact that, despite the choice of an early morning time for the bombing so as to minimize casualties, there will be a janitor taking his shift who will be killed in the scheduled explosions. Does that ring a bell? I don't think it's 1x03 ""Proportional Response"", I rewatched a few scenes from that one and couldn't find the dialogue."
43,The Introduction of Nancy McNally is an Underrated Moment in West Wing I am on my umpteenth rewatch of the show and I noticed now how perfect Nancy McNally's introduction to the show is in S2E1. She just appears and it took me until now to realize this is her first appearance in the show. She just naturally appears and is part of the scene. Its very impressive to me at least.
44,TIL some people still don't know this. 
45,The Leak - Military Shuttle Do you think Toby really did leak the story to Greg Brock?
46,"two of my favorite actors, one of which was in West Wing One of the great things about The West Wing was the character actors who showed up.  Sadly Wendell Pierce was not one of them.

47,"Why would anyone care that Andy's pregnant? I'm re-watching season 4 and I'm on the episode right after the election. Process Stories. The one where Toby is trying to get Andy to put out a statement about her pregnancy and remarry him. Why would the constituents care that she's pregnant or divorced? One of my senators had a baby last year and it was news, but otherwise a non-issue (other than babies being allowed on the senate floor now). Or have things really changed that much since TWW aired?"
48,Charlie McCarthy was the dummy. Edgar Bergen was the ventriloquist. 
49,"A new style of rewatch Spoilers, if it matters. 

I will preface this by saying I am a die hard fan of the show and have watched it back to front many times. Recently I realized that the last couple times I did a real rewatch I stopped after season 4 because I dreaded the second half of the show so much. In an attempt to reinvigorate myself on seasons 5-7 I decided to start this round ON season 5. 

It‚Äôs been a revelation. I honestly am really enjoying it. I think I was so attached to the core team that I just couldn‚Äôt accept seeing others on the screen. And the schism between Josh and Toby always depressed me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, still hate that plot point, but I can appreciate the device it is a little more this time. And I really enjoy watching Santos and Vinick. I think they are great characters and are each acted extremely well. I also love seeing Donna and Josh finally get
together. 

Anyways, just wanted to share in case anyone else has avoided the last couple seasons for awhile. Try them on their own without immediately coming off the good stuff. There‚Äôs a few stinker episodes in for sure but I think it‚Äôs a good way to appreciate it for what it is instead of comparing it to the golden years."
50,What if Vinick won? 
51,"Donna is kinda annoying. First, i've watched the West Wing at least 20 times in the last 10 years. I know its weird, I get shit from my friends and family all the time. Rewatching currently and I'm starting to notice that Donna is really annoying sometimes. She asked was to many questions and always seems to be up in everyone's business. Episode were Jack Reese is transferred for giving POTUS a force depletion report. She is talking about the buttons on his pants, telling Josh she saw reports about Naval forces in the Pacific. Then when Jack gets in trouble she starts asking way to many questions. IDK maybe i'm crazy but she sure is bougie AF!!"

53,"Season 4 Finale Does anyone else think that Aaron Sorkin was a little insane to write the season four finale, knowing he wouldn't be back for season five? ""Here staff writers. Have fun with this enormous mess I created."" 

(I'm assuming he had already made his plan to leave when he wrote that episode.)"
54,"Question about 1x21 (Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics) I never understood in this episode why Charlie had the run-in with the ambassador Ken Cochran. Ken recognizes Charlie where Charlie's introduces himself as the waiter at a club. This was clearly a point of contention, but why? Was is a racist Club?"

58,"Reflecting on the impact this show had on me, particularly President Bartlet and Leo. I‚Äôm 46, a former Republican, now progressive. I know characters are an amalgamation of writing, performance, editing etc.  But like many, when I see Martin Sheen I see President Bartlet.  Martin Sheen and John Spencer left an indelible mark on me as those two characters. Somehow I felt so comfortable with them that I would see them in my dreams on occasion. Somehow we‚Äôd have already met and quickly fell into pleasant conversation. 

I credit the show with a change in my view of government. One where positive change could be effected even if only in small steps. I later went on to live in Denmark and saw firsthand what a government can be like that regularly strives to improve life for all of its citizens.  

In these days it could easily be dismissed as a pipe dream but it doesn‚Äôt have to be. If we choose to fight for the better version of ourselves and push for a better version of this country it _is_ possible to make things actually better. Not just better for some, not just a temporary superficial better but one grounded in our most fundamental values like the golden rule. There are plenty of bad actors prepared to create and maintain a lopsided version of ‚Äúgood‚Äù but I firmly believe there are more of us who want to see a better future for all.  

Watching the video that was just released featuring several celebrities including Martin Sheen reminded me not the let my anger get the better of me. Leading me into a smoldering stupor.  It reminded me to keep my eyes clear, support this vision of the future in every way I can and not succumb to the cynicism of the age that tells us real change, real justice are fairytales.

Thank you West Wing for showing a vision of flawed people genuinely trying to make this country a better place."

68,"Season 5 Episode 11 Benign Prerogative Question \*\*\*\*Answered!!!\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Please forgive me if I'm asking a stupid question, or maybe I'm just bad at subtext, but sometimes with this show and many Sorkin shows, there's a lot in the subtext. Sorkin goes for substance and it's been my experience that he enjoys clever wordplay and deeper meanings. That said, this one line trips me up.

&amp;#x200B;

Charlie is showing Meeshell around the White House as a date. He takes her to the press room to show her where CJ addresses the press. Meeshell informs him that she'll be joining the press corp. Charlie becomes angry and informs her that everything he said and did during their day together is off-record and she is never to mention anything. He then says, ""He's not just the president.""

&amp;#x200B;

What exactly did Charlie mean by that particular line. Is it because he considers Bartlet to be more than just his boss, more than the president, but his friend and his father-figure?"
69,"Who gave Bartlet the napkin? Was rewatching the finale recently and this bothered me. Who on earth gave Bartlet the famous 'Bartlet For America' napkin.

Leo wrote it down and presented it to him when he was Governor and convinced him to run for President. Bartlet then gave this to Leo at the end of the BFA episode. Bartlet then receives it as a gift at the end of the finale. Who gave it to him? Did Leo do that before he died? Was it Josh? Mallory?"

75,"Top/Best/Favorite Episode of the Run? I'm halfway through my third watch of the series, and I just hit S04-E06 - Game On. For me, it's the single best episode of the entire series.

It manages to:

* Demonstrate all the best parts of all the characters

* Introduces Will, who is one of the strongest pieces of the ensemble in the latter half of the series

* Show perfectly how well Sorkin can write when he's really on it.

* Throw in the fact that it was directed by one of the best talents who worked on the show (Alex Graves, who also did In In Excelsis Deo, Galileo, Dead Irish Writers, Posse Comitatus, The Stormy Present, The Cold [another favorite]), and a bunch of others), and it just ticks all my boxes.

&amp;nbsp;

But I'm just one person. What do ya'll think is the best episode in the run? This doesn't have to be the objective best, although I think Game On is, it can also just be your favorite."

79,"H.Con-172 I rewatched ""H. Con-172"" last night, and two questions occurred to me:

(1)  After the deal offered by Calley (acceptance of censure in exchange for ending the hearings), presumably at the behest of the Speaker of the House (established later to have been Walken by this time, I think) and the rest of the Republican leadership, why wouldn't Rep. Gibson have gone ahead and leaked the story (of Leo's getting soused on the night of the last debate) anyway?  I know the real answer is that it would have been inconsistent with the plot directions the writers wanted to go, but it just seems unrealistic to me.  The portrayal of Gibson up to that point makes it almost certain in my mind that he would have disclosed, the deal notwithstanding.

(2)  How would the rest of S3 have played out if Bartlet hadn't accepted the deal?  Would it have made the election storyline more compelling?"
80,"A Map From 1709....? Watching HR 172, the episode were the president gets censured.

Charlie buys a map for the president. A map that he claims was hand drawn in 1709. If so, that would make this document older than the constitution and declaration. Two documents that are given almost surgical treatment when being handled for any reason. But they are treating like a $3 poster he picked up at Walmart. Now I know it‚Äôs not actually a really 300 year old map, but still surely they should have done something to show its fragility."

I have heard a lot of people discussing the idea that the reboot could be focused on a Seaborn Administration, bringing the chess game between Sam and President Bartlet in ‚ÄúHartsfield‚Äôs Landing‚Äù full circle.  I think this has the possibility of being a great reboot. 

But...what about Charlie? He was planning on going to law school at Georgetown when the series ended. He would now be in his 40‚Äôs. My guess is Charlie would have gone back into public service at some point. 

Could the rebooted series feature Charlie as a young, dynamic mayor of DC trying to make an unlikely run at the White House ala Mayor Pete? 

I know that Charlie was beloved by most West Wing fans (including me). The idea of Charlie‚Äôs story going from the President‚Äôs body man to the actual President would be pretty exciting. Just a thought. I would love to hear everyone‚Äôs thoughts on the possible reboot! Thanks for reading."

The first example that springs to my mind is Santos enrolling his kids in public schools, after having toured expensive, top-rated private schools. That made my eyes roll so far back into my head I could see my brain.

&amp;#x200B;

I had made several years ago this little compilation video that I called ""the road to the Santos White House"" picking out a few of the most key scenes during seasons 6 and 7 that highlighted the start to finish on Matt Santos becoming the new POTUS at the end of the series. It was about 15 minutes long but because how many channel was as the time, I had to split it into 2 parts. And they got a fair amount of views over the years but for the last 18 months or so I'd had this itch to completely remake it, but going quite a bit deeper. Though even being almost an hour long, I could have it in one neat, contained video. I'm happy enough with how the final cut came out, but Youtube wouldn't even let me upload it, for surely obvious reasons. I don't know how these channels that primarily feature fan edited compilations with tons of TV show or film footage are able to last on there. The last few times I've tried something, it gets flagged immediately. Anyway, this is why I'm presenting this now from my Vimeo page, as much as I would've preferred Youtube. They're far more lenient, but obviously not nearly as popular.

&amp;#x200B;

But in the revamping of this whole concept I wanted to do it in a way similar in size to what would've been a West Wing episode itself, of course a wee bit longer hahaa... more like an episode length from a cable series.

I'm pretty sure this was on West Wing (because no other show dealing with D.C. is smart enough) where someone (I think maybe it was Toby) was meeting with some Congress members' staff members at a restaurant.  The thing that sticks out, and what I want the example of, is that these two douchebags were so full of themselves that they were adjusting the menu in the most conceited ways possible.  Here they were at a VERY nice restaurant, obviously led by extremely capable chefs, and they both had to make a big show of how they knew better than the chef how to make their dishes.  Brilliant portrayal of the kind of madness that positions of power attracts.

* *17 People.* Toby confronting Leo about Hoynes' poll. The sound of the ball bouncing. The slow push-ins. That final ""What's going on, Leo?"" And the thundering sound of the ball. When the titles come, it's like we've just lit the fuse on the final leg of the season.
* *What Kind Of Day Has It Been.* Gina taking stock of the crowd at Rosslyn, noticing something's amiss, trying to figure it out, and then just as she spots something the music swells and BOOM, the titles. 
* *In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen Part I.* The natural companion to WKODHIB. Josh falling limply into Toby's hands gives me chills. The titles seem way too upbeat by contrast, which makes it all the more disturbing.

I'm personally in favor of a new cast, because the story of the last one was pretty well wrapped up, and as great as the show is, and it is great, it was more designed for the Clinton-era and its aftermath. I think a new administration will allow the show to be designed for the modern era, and you can have the original cast members occasionally making significant cameos."

So, one of the main reasons (other then their ability to, you know, talk about their feelings) that Josh and Donna don‚Äôt get together earlier, according to them, is that it would be inappropriate for Josh to date his assistant and it is implied it would cause all sorts of press issues.

I know everyone hates Mandy, but honestly she is so forgettable that I can't get myself to care enough about her to hate her.

The character I love to hate is Amy. I really can't understand why some people think she and Josh make a great couple. I mean, sure, their relationship is pretty passionate and they are equally intelligent/ambitious, but I think she crosses the line when she dumps Josh's phone in soup and cuts the phone cord.  That's some alarming behavior right there, and I'd recommend they both go see a therapist IRL. The only thing I appreciate about the Amy character is that she is such a stark contrast to Donna that she helps the viewers (me, at least) realize how much better Donna is for Josh.  I like that Donna ""wins"" in the end, and I revel in Amy's defeat in her quest for Josh.

I am halfway through season 6 but have gone ahead and spoiled myself to learn that Josh and Donna don‚Äôt get together until midway through season 7.  

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôve enjoyed the slow burn. But I do find it rather puzzling that throughout the length of the show they have these big moments of almost admitting or realizing their feelings for each other only for there to be another season long stretch of little to no movement for them. It seems a bit excessive and frustrating at times. 

I can understand not wanting to pull the trigger on them too early, but waiting until the last half of the final (SEVEN) season seems almost unfairly rushed for the sake of wrapping the show up. 

So I guess I‚Äôm wondering, from the creative standpoint was this the plan for them all along? Or was there no plan? We‚Äôre they unsure of what they wanted to do with them if they ever put them together? I‚Äôm just looking for more insight into this entire relationship behind the camera. Thanks!"

270,"The West Wing easter egg that I so wish WAS one but couldn't possibly actually BE one Alright folks, I'm putting my West Wing nerd-level to a bit of a test here lol... (&amp; btw, my background Twitter pic has always been the group shot from the s7 premiere of them standing outside the Bartlet library). I got an inch a few weeks ago to revisit the season 4 episodes surrounding the reelection. In 04x07 *Election Night*, Sam is making his first confession to another staff member (Donna) about the offer he made to Will Bailey that he'd be the Democrat to run should the utter impossibility of the deceased Horton Wilde winning the main election happen.

&amp;#x200B;

He says to Donna, *""This wasn't going to cost me anything. They weren't gonna announce unless Wilde won, and that was never gonna happen in Orange County. It's like the Secretary Of Agriculture saying 'Sure, I'm ready to assume the Presidency, should the 18 who come before me DIE'. So why not?""*

&amp;#x200B;

It kinda stuck in my head for a little bit that that number seemed a little familiar to something. Then it hit me. In the absolutely legendary episode 02x18 *17 People*, after Toby's finally been given the whole story about Bartlet's MS diagnosis, he points out that the number of people who were already aware being 16 wasn't strictly accurate, that Bartlet himself knew. Making it 17 people. Which, of course, would make one Mr. Toby Ziegler the 18th person to know. (and there's the added little kicker that the episode itself was the 18th of the season)

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as that kicked in, I had this ""oh my god that's too perfect"" moment, followed all of about 7 seconds later by ""okay moron, be real, that is WAY too friggin obscure of a thing that someone did that on purpose"" lol  Still, I love to think that Aaron Sorkin when he was writing this, knew he could just pick a totally random number to make Sam's line work, and somehow the synapses fired just right to make THAT be the reason he picked 18 :)"

But I would want to see Sam as Pres, with Josh as his CoS. Maybe Charlie is back as assistant CoS. Where, if anywhere, does Toby or CJ come in to play? How would replace them if? Just looking for some discussion"
275,"The Secret to Sorkin - Free Agency? Having watched TWW and The Newsroom countless times, I've come to realize the that Aaron Sorkin has a microscopic desire to create married characters unless it's completely necessary (every president in memory has a first lady).

  


The female characters are almost completely helpless in securing companionship despite a strong and open longing for it (Donna, CJ) and the men hardly ever seem to mention it unless they're being ""boyish"" or flatly immature.

  


Pretty sure of you add up the on-screen divorces they would heavily out-weigh the off-screen + on-screen marriages.

  


Do you think this contributes to the strong development between the main cast? Does it help or hurt stories? Is it even relevant at all?"

277,"1st President to be censured In season 3, episode 11 Leo McGary says that Bartlett censuring would be the ""1st time in history as a President has been censured""


Um, in 1834 President Andrew Jackson was censured."
278,"In which episode did Leo tell Toby the line ""we are no longer outsiders. we won. we are the establishment."" I don't remember the exact line, but it is roughly what I put in the post title. I believe Leo was talking to Toby and one other person (Josh or Sam). I also believe the context is that Josh or Toby got in an ideological fight with congressional leadership within their own party.

This line has surprising stuck with me and I'm having trouble figuring out which episode it was in.

Anyone remember this?"
279,"Sam‚Äôs Fianc√©e- My Wife‚Äôs Head Cannon Theory My wife and I and on our 8th or 9th rewatch and she made a casual comment last night that got me thinking. 

In season 8, when Josh is recruiting Sam to come work do Santos, Sam keeps talking about his fianc√©e and how is is hesitant to come work in DC again because of her. So my wife casually dropped, ‚Äú Yeah, because he went back and is marrying the hooker from season one, what‚Äôs her name from House...‚Äù

I was like...what? And then I though about it, and how Sam always kinda loved her no matter what. And I though, that‚Äôs kinda sweet. So now that‚Äôs in our head cannon, that Sam‚Äôs fianc√©e is Laurie the call girl from season 1."
280,"‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt all agree it‚Äôs a stupid ass amendment (...‚Äù) It was when Hoynes and the president were discussing Hoynes going down to Texas to speak against guns.

President Bartlet says (title) about the second amendment.

I‚Äôm amazed at that. That‚Äôs an incredibly specific and controversial opinion Sorkin wrote, and sure to have pissed off people  - it was **bold**."
281,"I convinced my mom to rewatch the west wing with me She watched it when it aired but hardly remembers anything, and since she‚Äôs been spending a lot of time watching politics and complaining, I figured it would be a good idea for her to escape that for a little bit. I managed to convince her by bringing up Lawrence O‚Äô Donnell, (since she watches his segment a lot) by saying he produced/wrote some episodes and played Bartlet‚Äôs abusive dad. 

Best decision I made. I can now watch and discuss it with someone and I love watching her reactions to the dialogue/plots because it‚Äôs like the first time watching for her. We ended up watching the first 5 episodes! (I thought she‚Äôd only wanna watch 1 or 2, but at the end of each episode she said ‚Äúone more!‚Äù) She laughed a lot and said it was how she remembers in terms of quality writing. She was also shocked at how tall Allison Janney was and that Bartlet‚Äôs full name was Josiah. üòÇ


And now I‚Äôm going to continue where I left off on my own rewatch on s3. I have a problem."
282,"Pixaladd? When the Surgeon General has a Q&amp;A session on marijuana, she takes a question from a guy calling himself Pixaladd (possibly spelled entirely different). What is this name a reference to? It seems related to 1960s rock or folk music?"
283,"I love the speeches The show is so fantastically well written that at any given moment I can normally recall a couple of sentences from 3 or more of the speeches in The West Wing. Tonight as lighting light up the sky all I could thing about was this one

""It was not a space ship from another planet, just another time. A long since abandoned Soviet satellite. One of its booster rockets didn't fire and it couldn't escape Earth's orbit. A sad reminder of a time when two powerful nations challenged each other and then boldly raced into outer space. What will be the next thing that challenges us, Toby? That makes us go farther and work harder? Do you know that when smallpox was eradicated, it was considered the single greatest humanitarian achievement of this century? Surely we can do it again, as we did in the times when our eyes looked towards the heavens and, with outstretched fingers, we touched the face of God. Here's to absent friends and the ones that are here now.""

What's your favourite or most memorised speech?"

290,"Okay, what's the deal with Elsie Snuffin? I know she got Mandy-ed, but that's not what I'm confused about.

Is she Will's sister? Step-sister? A writer he met while she was working on a comedy show?

Is she his step-sister who he learned was a good writer after he read some of her stuff while she was working on a comedy show? Why wouldn't he mention their relationship when he was talking to Sam in ""Game On""? 

It's also implied in that episode that he has several siblings and his parents were pretty old when he, the youngest, was born. Sam asks if he's his father's grandson because of the age gap. If they are old, and already have a bunch of kids, why would they adopt another one?

294,"Which short Sorkin? I‚Äôm a big fan of The Newsroom, and The West Wing is in my top three shows of all time. If I wanted to watch a great short Sorkin series, should I go for Sports Night or Studio 60? I think I know the answer, but I wanted to throw it out to the superfans."
295,"A quick (probably obvious) couple of questions about S3E20 ‚ÄúWe killed Yamamoto‚Äù I‚Äôve watched the series more times than I can remember, but I still seem to have questions about certain things. In this episode Fitzwallace and Leo are talking about terrorism and maybe targeting Sharif (sp?). Fitwallace mentions that women are giving birth to bombs does he mean that they are suicide bombers who pass off being pregnant to hide a bomb or does he mean that the children the women are giving birth to are growing up radicalised? Also I never quite understand if Fitz is for killing Sharif or not.

On a complete side note this episode is why I don‚Äôt like Amy in the slightest! Not relevant to my question, but she just gets me so cross!"
296,"Mandyville I have been a fan of TWW since it originally aired, and I have often been amused at Mandy‚Äôs trip off to Mandyville.  Turns out other shows have banished characters there. Sent them off, never to be heard from or even spoken of again. 

In the 1970s, Richie Cunningham‚Äôs brother Chuck (Happy Days) ascended the stairway to Mandyville. I like to think of him as the wise grandpa there. 

In the 90s, NYPD Blue sent Laura Kelly there after the first season. After the 3rd, Detective Lesniak was banished. 

In recent years, on The Blacklist, Liz Keen‚Äôs daughter, Agnes has departed for the verdant pastures. Hopefully Mandy is raising this toddler. 

I know I am missing many others. Who are the non-TWW residents of Mandyville?"
297,"Remember Lilli Mays? I'm going through yet another rewatch of the season one, and every time I get to 'The White House Pro Am' I am reminded of the Lilli Mays character. It's also the first and only time we see her. 

I know there's always talk of characters going to Mandyland or characters with super brief appearances, but I feel like this could've been a decent recurring character. Sam even acknowledges a struggle between the two staffs working together. I guess my point though, is that I always wished we saw Lilli Mays again."
298,"Noticed something interesting about the plane Toby is on in the pilot episode... In the opening scene Toby says this:
We're flying in a Lockheed Eagle series L1011. It came off the line 20 months ago. It carries a Sim-5 Transponder tracking system. Are you telling me I can still flummox this thing with something I bought at Radio Shack?

The Lockheed L-1011 was first produced in the late 60's. The last one was made in 1984.

So it brings the question: was this an error or were they still making those in 1998 in the West Wing universe?"
299,"Confession/Open admission of a TWW fan - I started uttering dialogues along side or even before the character is saying it while watching TWW videos on YouTube. üòÖ I have been a long time lurker here. Never posted anything before.

I love The West Wing. I started watching it due to my interest in geopolitics. I watched Newsroom before this. Loved its screenplay and dialogue. And then learnt, Sorkin, the creator excels at workplace dramas. And then I found TWW. It's my all time favorite show. I have atleast watched it 3 times in full. And watch few YouTube videos from time to time. It's kind of a solace for me these days whenever I listen to the news. Haha.

So, I started observing this behavior of mine few weeks ago. I would play a random YouTube video. Before the character says it, I will say it, almost with the same intonation. This is madness!  

Some of my friends know about my love for TWW. So, I pinged few of them and also shared this behavior of mine. Now, sharing with fellow TWW fans. Do any of you have any similar behavior? I don't really care for it but I never thought I will be passionate about anything this seriously. Haha
And, finally thanks for sharing all the trivia and your love for the show. It's good to know that there are others out there who feel the same way about a show you like."
300,"Sorkin easter egg - west wing/a few good men? Has anyone else spotted (possible) easter eggs connecting West Wing to other Sorkin-associated projects? This might be ridiculous, but, e.g., in S2 E5, Gen. Barrie, near the end of the episode, finally shows up at CJ's office. He's angrily trying to defend his record (vis-√°-vis CJ calling him cowardly) and says ""You think I have the time and inclination..."" but is cut off before finishing that sentence. Anyone else hear/feel a little bit of Nicholson in *A Few Good Men* during the famous court scene in the West Wing bit at all?"

Then a peppy flute chirps a happy diddy."
306,"Why didn't Mandy work out? Believe me, every time I rewatch the series I'm tired of Mandy after ten seconds. She definitely didn't gel with the cast and her character was annoying (emphasis on annoying). But why didn't she work out? Was it Moira Kelly's acting? Was it her role in storylines? I get it's kind of a dumb question(s) but I'm interested to hear people's thoughts."
307,"Best Sweet Moments? I'm sure this will draw a lot of examples, but let me be specific if that's alright: I just re-watched the episode ""Mr. Willis of Ohio"", and it included some great scenes with an 8th grade teacher who's wife was in congress. Just quiet, human moments that sort of remind the main characters (in this case Toby) how not everything has to do with Washington DC cagefights.

Another good example is Josh and Toby at the bar with the father in Hours In America part 2.

Can people think of other scenes with nice, sweet, little human moments?"
308,"Toby was from New York, right? "
309,"Just finished Season 7's Election Day Part II (spoilers) And now I need a hug. I know it had a happy ending, and I had been spoiled on what happened to Leo, and I realize I'm over a decade late to this party. But even so, what a loss. I can only imagine what that experience must have been like for the cast, to lose someone who they had worked with for almost 10 years, and then to go on filming. If anyone has interviews about this from the cast, feel free to share. 

Not looking forward to finishing this series. Glad I watched it, I guess better late than never."
310,"Did Leo have PTSD? I was thinking about Leo‚Äôs excellent speech at the end of *Noel*, the one about a guy in the hole, and the ‚Äúpunchline‚Äù of his friend jumping in the hole and helping because he‚Äôs been down there before.

This is Leo sympathizing with Josh‚Äôs situation (PTSD) and remarking about his own troubles. Now, I am like 99% certain that Leo is specifically talking about his alcohol problem, but he was a Vietnam pilot who saw action and bombed targets (one that we learn could be construed as a war crime). Could Leo implicitly be saying that he too suffer(ed) from PTSD? I don‚Äôt remember the show ever implied it elsewhere, but since Josh is experiencing it and Leo tells a story that says he was in the same hole, were they hinting at it."
311,"In Hartsfield's Landing S3:E15 Bartlet tells Sam he's going to run for president one day. If Sorkin stays with the show does Sam come back and run? It just seems like this episode shows the president grooming Sam. ""See the whole board"" is the mantra. I wonder if there was some intentional foreshadowing there that never came to fruition because of the way things ended up going."

314,"What would‚Äôve happened if Santos criticized the bartlet administration during the campaign? I Personally feel like he should‚Äôve really criticized the administration during the security leak. They really weren‚Äôt useful during the campaign and were honestly just bringing down the campaign. From taking Santos education plan to coordinating with the grand jury instead of calling for a special prosecutor. Just seemed like a whole lot of shit for him to have called them out on. Not to mention when he brings Vinnick with him after the nuclear power plant incident even though he‚Äôs the republican nominee and could‚Äôve potentially wiped out the chances of santos winning had the press not found out about vinnick pushing for the plant. It all just seemed like bartlet didn‚Äôt think santos could win and didn‚Äôt even bother to try helping in any way he could.

Josh was right in threatening to criticize the White House when they dealt away the education plan. He should‚Äôve recommended to santos to do that, he would‚Äôve separated himself from the bartlet administration and wouldn‚Äôt have been asked questions when the security leak situation came to be.

&amp;#x200B;

1. ""We need to have a discussion and we need to have it tonight.""   &lt;----Multiple people are adamant that there must be a discussion and yet there was never a discussion
2. ""It's answer B"" &lt;----Josh tells Toby that the president isn't running again and we go to commercial and come back after the interview where President Barlet tells the world he has MS (Side note, the TV interviewer didn't ask if he was going to run again?)
3. ""First row, first seat on your right"" &lt;---CJ is adamant that the president needs a softball question about his health when it's already been stated that ""it's answer B"" (Which we would assume the interviewer would have asked about)
4. No one in The West Wing (the support staff) seems to have a reaction to the President admitting he has MS even though we're told that 60% of Democrats won't vote for him because he lied by Joey Lucas (played by the amazing Marlee Matlin)

&amp;#x200B;

So the president lied. His staff is upset that he lied. Then they all demand they form a plan together and the **president cuts them out again** (makes the decision without them). Then &lt;spoiler&gt; he completely changes his mind again after telling no one.

He sees guys playing cricket, a game he doesn't even know just to talk about it? AND he meets the one Bermudan who was at the airport and met US SOF at the gate?

354,"Jordan Kendall, J.D. Season 3's underrated heat-check (basketball term) preformer. Such a wonderful and well-written character who has to handle the second most powerful man (Leo) on the show - and not always when he's at his best.

It's Jordan who sees all along that a centure is the best course of action for the White House and is relentless in getting that across to her client. She's intelligent, direct and has great style too. The scene where she asks Cliff Cally to move the Capitol Police to the other side of the hall is a reasonable presentation of her vulnerability that doesn't wreek of femine subservientness.

Thoughtful and developed minor characters should be celebrated. Just thought I'd share. What's next?"
355,"So like am I the only one who‚Äôs HATES Will and Donna during seasons 6-7??? So personally, I liked the characters for a big amount of time until 1.) Will got hired by the VP 2.) Donna joined the VP campaign. Here‚Äôs why:

- Will just seemed like such a pain in the ass, for example during Bartlet‚Äôs trip to China during 6x09 and 6x10. The president has an MS episode and while there are already physicians etc lined up to speak to the press, Will takes this as a time to make sure the VP gives a statement and the damn VP goes along with it and just to stick the knife in further, Russell uses that damn line about playing tennis when he heard the news, it just seemed to me that neither Russell nor Will had any type of respect for the president or the country since this clearly was a campaign stunt for them. Another instance was when during the SAME episode, they tried holding a damn cabinet meeting where they clearly were going to try and invoke the 25th amendment on Bartlet. That just showed so much disrespect and left a sour taste in my mouth.

- Another instance was when baker visited the White House and Will inserted Russell into the photo op to avoid it only being Bartlet and baker. Bartlet himself even told Russell never to do that again, he even said that he wasn‚Äôt choosing between either of them so it wasn‚Äôt even anything to do with the campaign just baker and the president taking a photo with some historic thing (I forgot what it was). Personally, I think Bartlet should‚Äôve fired Will‚Äôs ass after that incident. It‚Äôs still his administration and still him governing till the final minute. 

- Donna really came off to me as annoying and full of herself when the New Hampshire primaries came around. She didn‚Äôt finish college and just expected a promotion to come her way because she worked in the White House under Josh for a long time. Will coming up to her with a job offer was definitely a little punch at Josh and Donna accepting was also a big backstab. She considered herself to be on Josh‚Äôs level of expertise just because Will gave her a job, she wasn‚Äôt even in charge of anything. I remember one quote from 6x11 where she says sarcastically ‚ÄúYes, I let Will seduce me with a salary and actual political support‚Äù political support how?? Bingo bob had none lmao it‚Äôs why his ass was neck and neck with Santos at the convention. She‚Äôs literally just working on media targeting like come on. She makes it seem as if she‚Äôs on the same level now and tries to throw it all in Josh‚Äôs face. 

Another moment that really irritates me is when she tries to get a job at the santos campaign and she tries to dismiss the comments she made about santos during the campaign as ‚Äúdoing her job‚Äù. The quote that really pissed me off was her saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not used to seeing me in a position of power, I can see how that makes you uncomfortable.‚Äù It‚Äôs not even that, it‚Äôs the fact that she felt a little bit of power and instead of using it for good like Josh she used it to slander opponents and gain a few fractions in the polls. It put a smile on my face when josh didn‚Äôt even let her get past the interview stage. She Deserved every bit of that.

Final case: they‚Äôre both shitty characters in the end tbh. It kinda pissed me off that she ended up working for the campaign and santos administration in the end but oh well. The fact that Josh didn‚Äôt even ask Will to stay on was also pretty dope tbh. Sucks that he became a congressman later on, I feel that more than likely josh didn‚Äôt tell santos to help him out when he started campaigning. If he helped Russell more than likely he shared some views with the VP.

356,"""Lies, Damn Lies &amp; Statistics"" So in Season 1 Episode 2 - Sam tells Laurie ""There isn't a BAR in America that's going to admit you with a solicitation bust on your record""

&amp;#x200B;

And then in Episode 21 of Season 1 - We find out that the picture of Sam and Laurie was setup by her friend who also confirmed to the media outlet that published it that she was a call girl.

&amp;#x200B;

When the President finds out, he says he will personally see to it that the A.G. admits her to the BAR.

&amp;#x200B;

So, by meeting with Laurie (after being told not to) and using her friend - Is it possible Sam basically ruined the career of a would-be lawyer before it could have even gotten started? And after she had claimed she only was a call girl to pay for law school (which is now worthless and she did all of that illegal activity for nothing).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering if that's a (or one of the) reason(s) we never heard form Laurie again."

2) The characters in the show really make me feel like shit about myself sometimes. I didn‚Äôt go to an Ivy League school, I didn‚Äôt score a 1590 on the SAT, and I don‚Äôt think I have the ability to work 18 hours a day like they seem to do in the show.

366,"So I rewatched season 7‚Äôs last few episodes...Santo‚Äôs is such an ass**** The last season is passable, I enjoyed the whole campaign plot and what not. I just didn‚Äôt end up liking santos as much as I did when we first meet him in season 6. Here are a few reasons and ill try to cite certain episodes.

- He treats josh like a second thought even though this is the guy that pretty much got him to the fucking White House. For example in 7x09, we have a bunch of people recommending that josh be let go as campaign manager, and santos just takes it and doesn‚Äôt try to defend him at all. I think it‚Äôs BS that he ended up turning his back on him like that, I especially hated that he took Goodwin‚Äôs advice when Goodwin tried acting like an alley to josh earlier in that episode. (More on how much I hate Goodwin later.)

- Goodwin comes out of nowhere and honestly has no real connection to Santos during the campaign. Yet for whatever reason santo‚Äôs always seems to go along with Goodwin like when wanted to head the transition team he let him do it. Or when he wanted josh replaced by Leo as campaign manager, he once again willingly listened. I remember during the speaker race that josh wanted santo‚Äôs to remain neutral but santos kept mentioning how Goodwin thought he should throw his support behind his old pal. It just seems to me that santo‚Äôs didn‚Äôt feel as if he were in josh‚Äôs debt and that the only person that‚Äôs really looking out for him is josh.

Overall, it‚Äôs not surprising that so many AU‚Äôs have santos being a one term president tbh. He‚Äôs just so damn flip floppy when it comes to his own team especially josh and tbh if Goodwin was a part of his administration then that for sure concludes that his presidency would‚Äôve been one term. He‚Äôs more willing to listen to anyone that he thinks has something important to say when really the only one who should be helping him out is his chief of staff which is josh.
Even he realizes that santos is looking for a yes man during the transition which I personally think is ridiculous."

371,"Favorite 'weaker' episodes 'Weaker' in quotes because so few of them are weak in any real way compared to anything else on tv, but I mean it more in the sense of 'we can't all be Two Cathedrals'. Are there any less critically acclaimed/generally beloved episodes that you have a soft spot for? Or episodes you think have significant flaws but like for random reasons you can't rationally defend? Or even widely disliked episodes you loved? My best friend just finished watching and put The Long Goodbye in her top 10, which.. surprised me to say the least lol but it got me wondering what other people's unconventional favs are.

I have a lot of them (pretty much the entire Santos primary/general election arc was top tier for me) but the one I love most intensely is Holy Night. It's by far my favorite holiday ep, and one of my favorite eps in general, even though I agree with the consensus that it's objectively (as objective as these things can be) the weakest holiday one of the Sorkin years, and the narrative's symmetry is pretty heavy handed. But Tobby is my favorite character, and I like Mafia stories, Yiddish and a cappella to a degree where when I was first watching it I was like 'wtf was this specifically designed to be my favorite episode'. I also love Santa Danny and the goldfish pin, and lol every time at 'I'm told that on my sunniest of days, I'm not that fun to be around. I wonder what's gonna happen when you make my children a part of your life'. 

Finally this exchange between Toby and Josh for me was one of the most moving of the entire show (and I don't say that lightly for this show):

&gt;\-It was desperation. It wasn't out of a desire to do evil. He had a young family and he barely spoke the language, and he went to jail. He went to jail, and you went to school, and it was all a half-century ago. Look what he did in two generations. What room did you just walk out of?  
&gt;  
&gt;\-I appreciate that that's what you think. Do I get to think what I think?   
&gt;  
&gt;\-No, you don't, cause you don't know what I know.   
&gt;  
&gt;\- What?   
&gt;  
&gt;\-That I would give anything to have a living father who was a felon. Or a sister with a past.

What about everyone else? This is a judgement-free zone for Mandy stans, Will+Kate shippers, and season 5."

Toby: 

‚ÄúI do know that if you combine the populations of Great Britain,

Japan, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark and Australia you've got a population
roughly the size
of the United States. We had 32,000 gun deaths last year and they had 112. Do

1.) Bartlet giving Charlie the knife. I think it‚Äôs one of the most touching scenes in the series.

Add in that Charlie never had a father figure in his life and you have me in tears. 

2.) CJ growing attached to the turkeys and fighting to get the second one pardoned.

‚ÄúTroy, I want you to know it was neck and neck, but I‚Äôm giving it to Eric.‚Äù

382,"Plot Hole? I am on my first watch of the show, and I love it. I'm well past season one but I was thinking about the finale of that season, and how it is later revealed that the assassination attempt was not aimed at the president, but at Charlie. Does this bother anyone else? Why would a group target him when he's with the president, one of the most well protected men in the world? Why not follow him home one day? If their main goal is to kill Charlie, why do it when he's surrounded by two hundred people? There isn't really any logic to this that I can think of, and there wasn't a specific reason to include it. Why did Sorkin make this decision?"
383,"""Commencement"" open - Leo for VP? In the opening to the season 4 penultimate episode, Josh is reviewing potential VP replacements for the resigned Hoynes. At scene end, he considers Leo. 

Is this a good overall strategic idea? Isn't the administration and the country better off with Leo's talents as Chief of Staff - a seemingly much more vital position than VP?  Does the COS' influence diminish greatly in the last year of the administration? 

Seems if they had followed that approach they'd drastically weaken the presidency, White House staff and national security. Would there be anything positive by the move other than personal honor and gain? "

449,"How has the show affected the way you view other political series/movies? When I was watching the first season of House of Cards, two things really stood out that I don't think would have stood out so sharply before having watched TWW.

First, that Underwood can move so many pieces around by himself (before and after his ascension) with everyone else being clueless, but I guess that's what you have to buy in for the series to work. 

Second, and the more important thing, is how empty the White House felt in the first season, in terms of background extras and how few higher level staff actually interacted with President 1 and Frank Underwood. HoC is definitely intended as more of a chamber play, but it would probably be harder to suspend disbelief in how much scheming is pulled off if there was a constant buzz of activity in the background."

(I am watching the Director of EMILY's List on Seth Meyers' show at the moment, if you are curious).

I am from the UK, and I have to say The West Wing doesn't really make it clear, and over in the UK the money for election things is not as big a thing as it is in America, because election cycles are TINY compared to elections cycles in America.

I realise it might have been obvious to everyone else who watched the show, and I might be really late to the table on this, but - honestly - I kind of figured Emily was someone who founded the group.

And it also kind of makes sense why CJ was saying that now - that kind of confused me as well, but I figured it was the motto of the group :)"

*I am not commenting on the actual policies of each candidate and this is Not meant to inspire political debate. I just think it would be fun to explore! 

Josh-  Pete Buttigieg.  I think it plays into his search for an underdog with promise. Buttigieg is a long shot but has so far been rather impressive in town halls.

Toby- Beto O‚ÄôRouke. Toby‚Äôs monologue to Josh about a candidate not needing to be ‚Äúconvinced‚Äù to run and feeling that they are destined for it! Based of O‚ÄôRoukes recent Vanity Fair article.

Will- Biden. A safe bet and plays into the VP story line. 
 
CJ- Elizabeth Warren. Based off various opinions CJ has voiced through out the series, plus I would imagine she would prefer to support a female candidate.

Everyone thought it was a joke - and it was, cause it turned out we produced 100,000 planes - give the Air Force an armada that would block the sun."" This may seem nitpicky to some, but there was no Air Force in 1940. The branch I'm incredibly proud to be a veteran of wasn't established until 1947.

468,"Am I alone in thinking Toby's arc makes sense? [SPOILERS] SPOILERS BELOW

I‚Äôve seen many people deride the writers‚Äô decisions for Toby in the last season or two. Richard Schiff was famously bitter for his character‚Äôs direction in the final seasons, claiming the writers didn‚Äôt understand Toby and wrote him as a ‚Äúgrump.‚Äù Some posit that the leak plot-line was meant as punishment for the actor‚Äôs demands and comments.

Everything I‚Äôve seen from reddit users regarding Toby and the military shuttle leak share the same sentiment: Toby would never do that, I hate what they did with Toby, they didn‚Äôt understand Toby at all.

I am here to present a counter-argument. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the leak subplot, but I loved what they did with Toby and thought it made perfect sense.


First, Toby has always been ethically driven. Over the course of the series, he consistently proves his regard for moral obligations over direct orders. Nothing so drastic as the leak, but from the beginning, Toby is a warrior for righteousness, sometimes to a fault. I love Toby, and consider him one of my favorite characters for this reason. But when Bartlett accuses him of having always considered himself morally superior, I accepted that. I think that‚Äôs true.

So am I saying that season 1-3 Toby would have leaked the shuttle? Maybe, but probably not. However, he is not the same man by the time we get to season 7. Let‚Äôs look at Toby‚Äôs relationships over the course of the series.

When Sam leaves, Toby understands, but it doesn‚Äôt make it hurt any less. It was almost like getting a second divorce. His best friend, collaborator, and most trusted colleague left him.

~~At some point, his father dies, though my memory of the timing is foggy.~~

Then, Josh leaves for the Santos campaign, and doesn‚Äôt ask Toby to join him. We find out later that this wounded Toby deeply. Another colleague he respects and considers a close friend has vanished. 

Finally, his brother ‚Äî the astronaut ‚Äî commits suicide soon after being diagnosed with cancer (I don‚Äôt remember exactly where this falls, but it is before any of the leak stuff begins.) In this episode, he is clearly badly affected. It goes without saying that this has a profound and lasting impact on Toby, as it would any of us.
 

So ultimately, as I was watching, I understood S6-7 Toby to be someone who felt abandoned, alone, and beaten down. I think his sense of loyalty to the administration as a body was badly damaged.

So this is the Toby who leaks the shuttle information. A man, judgement skewed by his brother‚Äôs recent death, who considers the pursuit of the pure ethical choice to be paramount, greater than any loyalty, makes a decision. He then accepts the consequences, relinquishing neither CJ nor his brother‚Äôs reputation as bargaining chips.



I thought it was fantastic. And it added a realistic layer to the show by depriving a main character of a neat, happy ending. Eight years is a long time to spend in that environment. Relationships will fracture, people will change.

I, for one, am a Toby fan to the end.


EDIT: Father didn‚Äôt die, I just imagined that."
469,Should I continue watching after season 4? I love the show and the main thing I like about the show is Aaron Sorkin's writing. Is there a huge decline in quality after he leaves?

472,"One of my favorite low key funny moments with Danny and Josh In S07E18, this happens at the party thing after Leo's funeral. Donna asks CJ is she can stay over and so CJ can't go to Danny's. And then Josh offers a place and Donna can't unask CJ.

And then Danny comes and sits with Josh and you can see that both are sad about not getting any action. And I find that so funny, not so much the setup, it's mostly the acting that really makes it funny. It's probably my favorite low key humor moment in the entire show.

Are there any other moments like this? I love rewatching scenes like this. "
473,"I enjoyed rewatching starting on season seven. Hear me out... I re-started on season 7 because of its heavy focus on the campaign and the way it ends with this new, exciting energy of starting in the White House. 

And then start on season 1 and think of how Josh and Sam and Toby and CJ are everyone is coming off a campaign and are in their first year in the White House and then watch that slowly fade over the seasons and then see the Santos campain and that new breath of a new president.

So what are the odds that the one actor who dies before the series ends is John Spencer who plays McGarry? That opening scene would have become very awkward had Spencer been included in it, or if one of the included actors had died instead.

&amp;#x200B;

The scene also includes the new president whom we know to be a Democrat since Josh is pretty happy in that scene, so excluding McGarry couldn't have been an attempt to not reveal the identity of the new president.... UNLESS, and hear me out here, it might have been McGarry instead of Santos. What if producers were entertaining the possibility that Santos had been replaced by McGarry for some reason? That would explain why we never saw either McGarry or Santos.

DONNA: It turns out I'm not an American citizen, so Secret Service wanted me to talk to INS.

C.J.: What?

DONNA: I was born in Warroad, Minnesota, only I wasn't, 'cause INS just clarified the border, and it's now in Manitoba.

C.J.: You're not an American?

DONNA: Missed it by four miles.

AMY: You seem pretty calm about it.

DONNA: **No, I'm very upset. I don't know the words to my national anthem. I've been throwing out Canadian pennies my whole life. I've been making fun of the Queen. We don't do that.**

ABBEY: I'm sure it'll all work out.

DONNA: Thank you, ma'am. [*turns to leave*]

ABBEY: Where are you going?

DONNA: They've let me into the party now.

ABBEY: Why don't you stay and have some wine with us?

DONNA: Really?

ABBEY: Yeah.

DONNA:  That's very nice of you. [sits] I probably shouldn't drink though.

C.J.: I wouldn't worry about it.

**AMY: Canadian, huh?**

**DONNA:  Yeah.**

**AMY: You feel funnier?**

**DONNA:  No, but I am developing a massive inferiority complex.**

AMY: Mrs. Bartlet, I wanted to ask you a question, but I'm not sure how.

ABBEY:What?

AMY: Well, if the most they can give you is a year's suspension, is it...?

ABBEY: That big a deal?

AMY: Yes.

ABBEY: Yes. I'm a doctor. It's not like changing your major. You of all people should... I mean women talk about their husbands overshadowing their careers. Mine got eaten.

C.J.: Your husband got eaten?

ABBEY: My career.

C.J.: Yeah. Well, I'm on dangling modifier patrol.

ABBEY: What's your problem?

C.J.: Are you First Lady right now?

ABBEY: What are you talking about?

C.J.:  Sometimes you like to talk, and I think that's great, but sometimes you're Abbey, and sometimes you're my boss, and I respect both very much, but...

ABBEY: I'm Abbey.

C.J.: Yes. I agree with her. [*points to Amy*] Look, they take this job away from me, I got 
nothing....I don't have a cat....I could get one, but I don't have one....Frankly, I'm not 
wild about cats. I don't hate them. I'm just not... I could learn to like them, I guess, 
if I...

ABBEY:  C.J.?

C.J.:  You've got a husband, children, a home and a life. And we're talking about one year of 
your not having a medical license.

ABBEY: Jed got censured, and that came with no tangible penalty, and it was a banner headline, and he's having a slow nervous breakdown.

C.J.: That's different.

ABBEY: Why?

C.J.: Because it is, and you know it.

ABBEY: Okay. I‚ÄôM FIRST LADY AGAIN.

C.J. : Okay.

AMY: You're First Lady, Abbey?

ABBEY: Yes.

AMY: And it's not like it's been a detour from health care.

ABBEY: No.

AMY:  What?  You've expanded Medicare to cover mammograms, cancer clinical trials... That's money that could've gone to Viagra. You were the one that said ""no dice"" to cutting infant nutrition programs, nursing home standards...

C.J.:  There's plenty of stuff left.

AMY : ...child immunizations, juvenile diabetes...

ABBEY: That's not the point.

AMY: What's the point?

ABBEY: I'm a doctor.

DONNA: **Oh, Mrs. Bartlet, for crying out loud, you were also a doctor when your husband said, ‚ÄúGive me the drugs, and don't tell anybody,"" and you said, ""Okay.""**

[*An uncomfortable silence fills the room. Everyone looks at Donna.*]

DONNA: **Oh, my God. You switched back to First Lady.**

ABBEY: That's all right.

DONNA: I'm so sorry, Mrs. Bartlet.

[*Donna walks up to them from behind.*]

DONNA: Mrs. Bartlet?

ABBEY: Yes?

DONNA: Excuse me, but I'm so sorry about the way I spoke before.

ABBEY: Oh, don't be. You were good. I've got a surprise for you coming up.

DONNA: Really?

JOSH APPROACHES: Donna, you're an American again! INS has a grandfather clause. If you pass a three-part literacy test, an American history exam, and fill out a one-page form, you're back.

DONNA: My adopted country.

ABBEY: Oh, Josh, I kind of wished you'd mentioned this before.

JOSH: Why?

[*Drumroll. Fanfare, suddenly The Canadian National Anthem begins.*]

 **‚ÄùO, Canada.‚Äù**

DONNA: Wow.

[*Two Canadian flags are raised Donna watches in amazement.*]

ABBEY:  You were very good in there, Donna.

[*Behind them, Bartlet approaches with Charlie as O, Canada, we stand on guard for thee can be heard loudly*]

BARTLET: **WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!**

ABBEY: Shh.

BARTLET: I was only gone for 45 minutes. They were all Americans when I left.

DONNA:  **I know exactly how you feel, Mr. President.**

BARTLET: Okay. Here we go.

CHARLIE: Time is tight.

BARTLET: That's when the juices get flowing.

CHARLIE: I'm not sure we have time for juices, sir

BARTLET: I could tell the story of the ditch digger.

CHARLIE: Sir?

BARTLET: You know the story?

CHARLIE: I do not.

BARTLET: Abbey and I were walking along and we see a ditch digger, and I said, ""Aren't you glad you married me? You could've married a ditch digger."" And she said, ""Jed, if I'd married him, he'd be President."" What do you think?

CHARLIE: Not so sure, sir.

BARTLET: Why?

CHARLIE: ‚ÄòCause it seems like a story about how cool you are.

Leo approaches The President while he‚Äôs working on his toast with Charlie.

[*Bartlet and Leo walk away*]

LEO: What's gonna happen?

BARTLET: They're gonna suspend her license for a year.

LEO: We just talked for a little bit.

BARTLET: And?

LEO: I don't think you need to be concerned about her leaving you for me.

BARTLET: I was pretty concerned about that.

LEO: She's definitely leaving you for somebody, so don't be so...

BARTLET: Can you leave me alone? I'm trying to be a husband, and your mojo's getting all over me.

First Sam says to Donna that he‚Äôd like to run for Congress for real one day and doesn‚Äôt want to screw up those chances by getting thumped here.  Then Toby is talking about the same thing, and says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a name for that‚Äù, like it‚Äôs some kind of crime or something to run again after losing a race? Surely not?

512,Joe Quincy...super spy? I somehow never realized that Joe Quincy (Mathew  Perry) was instrumental in the removal of both the Vice President and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court while only being around for 3 episodes. Considering how much success he had in disrupting the government I can only surmise the reason why he just disappeared was because he retired quite comfortably to a beautiful dacha on the Black Sea with his estranged wife Mandy.
513,"Will gets a present on his new desk...who sent it? Will walks in to his office after talking to C.J about his press briefing (S7 ep 6) and finds a bow-wrapped Spalding high-bounce ball on his desk. My first assumption is that Toby sent it.

It's nice that they overcome their cynicism because Stackhouse was personally involved, but they are supposed to be representing all of the people. I don't know, I guess I just feel like it sends a bad message that you have to know a senator for your government to care about you."

521,"Times when President Bartlet was rude... I don't know about you, but there are times when I cringe over something PB said and think it is just plain rude. 

Number 1 for me would be when he is conferring the Thai ambassador, who is interested in sport. He dismisses golf as a sport and instead suggests the two shall talk about other things as men do. 

Number 2 for me is when Toby is spoken to by his rabbi about the death penalty. Toby speaks to PB about it, and PB mocks him to Leo by saying 'Toby went to schul' (apologies, don't know the spelling). Ironically though, PB had reached out to Fr Cavanagh from within his own religion to give him counsel. 

Other examples? Or am I to be burned at the stake for mentioning it?! "

The drive from Dayton to DC is 7hr 52min.

Assuming the reunion takes place around 7, maybe gets the call around 8pm, she could actually get back to DC about 3 hours sooner, which would probably be important for someone in such a position.

534,"Question: Presidential Debate Formats Anyone who has watched both ‚ÄòThe West Wing‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Newsroom‚Äô is likely familiar with both series take on the flawed US presidential debates. 

I always find this as an interesting take and really my answer is ‚ÄúYes, sure I‚Äôd love to see more Sorkin-esque Presidential Debates‚Äù, but I just realized that the episodes this is really highlighted in occur post Sorkin years? Yes, this does come up during Bartlet‚Äôs re-election campaign but not as detailed prominently yet ‚ÄòThe Newsroom‚Äô has the exact same almost verbatim view on this in season one. 

This leaves me with two questions. 

Does anyone else feel that Aaron Sorkin‚Äôs view on ‚ÄúDebating‚Äù really is a great one that should be enacted? Would this make a difference and is it actually possible? 

And is this truly Sorkin‚Äôs view, since he claims to have never watched the post Sorkin years on TWW and plays out this exact debate fantasy on ‚ÄòThe Newsroom‚Äô ? 

I guess it‚Äôs possible the writing covered enough in the Bartlet re-elect, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem like it during this binge which is why I‚Äôm curious what other‚Äôs think. I always attributed this view to Aaron Sorkin. "
535,"Wants some opinions on ‚ÄúFull Disclosure‚Äù S5E15 *Spoiler* What did you all think of the CJ-Hoynes situation? The first time I watched I thought it was stupid fodder to add a new depth to CJ but on the most recent watch(4th or 5th watch) I saw it as a good character growth for CJ in moving on and her regret over the incident. Plus it finally got her on the phone with Ben, which made Carol happy for about 5 minutes which is always nice. 

Anyway. What‚Äôs your thoughts? Because even as I type this I‚Äôm going back to the fodder opinion. Can‚Äôt make up my mind. "

Everyone went to him for advise and he seem to embody the only ""Normal "" American with screen time. It could just be me but I wanted to put this out there for thought.

Instead of dropping it after she misses the question, he asks again. Is he suggesting (or suspicious that) the staffer had spent the night at the VP‚Äôs place? It was raining and wouldn‚Äôt be crazy to think someone who typically would walk or take the bus might spring for a cab on such an important and early-morning errand. "
544,"Sorkin and speechwriters To all my American friends - I would like to understand how important is the role of a speechwriter in the White House, when it comes to policy. I would think that it would be policy decisions that would affect speech writing and not the other way.

But Sorkin on his shows portrays a very high importance on these roles- Toby and Sam in TWW (Sam was supposed to be the main lead in the beginning of the show) and even Will in the newsroom.

So I would like to understand if it is accurate or maybe a little exaggerated as Sorkin himself is a writer?"

Josh so far has been one of my top characters and his story in this episode was just so masterfully done. Kudos to Sorkin for the beautiful writing, the build-up to Josh finally revealing how it actually happened was edited so well and the tension was so strong.

553,"Following along with all the Reboot Idea‚Äôs.... Doesn‚Äôt Congresswoman Wyatt make a lot of sense? [Andrea Wyatt(-Ziegler?) for president](https://imgur.com/a/b37VSw6)

[I was Inspired by this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/asy9jq/if_were_giving_reboot_ideas_heres_mine/?st=JSG9YL1X&amp;sh=f8afdc07) and then thought to myself seriously wouldn‚Äôt Congresswoman Wyatt make an excellent POTUS storyline in a reboot: 

1. A Female President ‚úîÔ∏è 

‚Ä¢Follows almost all current TV network trends.

‚Ä¢Definitely could serve to add even more to Sorkin‚Äôs specific brand of political idealism. 

2. She automatically injects countless opportunities for conflict. Her campaigning alone would takes us through numerous rollercoasters and of course even more while she was in office ‚úîÔ∏è 

‚Ä¢First off Toby‚Äôs connection to her alone serves this purpose. 

‚Ä¢Add in those pregnancy lawsuits. 

‚Ä¢Even her own season 7 (likely)come from behind congressional win, after having always won her district with 85% of the vote, all because Toby was charged. 

3. Andy Wyatt definitely provides probably the most legitimate reason‚Äôs to include or call back to serve, most if not all of the original ensemble ‚úîÔ∏è 

‚Ä¢They all served as trusted advisors to Bartlet together (think Debate Camp). 

‚Ä¢They all seemed to be roughly the same age/generation. This makes a lot more sense if you think about it-Bringing back what would be considered a much older administration with Charlie young as President would be harder if they all came right back into the WH and with Wyatt this plus they could all maybe even return with some as Sr staff. This is just more plausible with her. 

‚Ä¢Wyatt already worked with all of these political operatives why would she even change that? 

4. Wyatt would even be one of the easiest way‚Äôs for Sorkin to write the party politics the same way he did in the original ‚úîÔ∏è 

‚Ä¢Her political views mostly lined up with Bartlet‚Äôs Administration. 

‚Ä¢Her history would have obviously much more likely stayed the same course politically. 

5.She even sorta opens the door a little wider for old recurring only characters. 

‚Ä¢For example Amy could return with some pretty awesome storylines 

‚Ä¢ This maybe gives Donna a much better shot at a more deserving role in an administration. 

‚Ä¢Especially since both Donna and Amy served in Santos administration and just as Amy was Abbeys COS Donna was Helen‚Äôs. 

‚Ä¢**But lets get to what‚Äôs really the most important here....I personally feel Andy was obviously always pretty tight with Ed and Larry and for me there‚Äôs simply just no possibility for a reboot without Ed and Larry!** 

6.She is probably the only possibility that really serves to legitimize Toby‚Äôs return well! 

*I‚Äôm just saying Congress Woman Wyatt really makes so much sense here and imo the most important reason for that is because so far she would serve as clearly the easiest way for Aaron Sorkin to overcome the major Toby problem which would absolutely be a gigantic obstacle for him.*

*Richard Schiffs Toby is one of Sorkin‚Äôs personal all time favorite characters he has ever written.  He says this a lot. Wyatt for president really does almost instantly overcome that objection and at the very least provides Sorkin opportunities that since S7 are very necessary for him to continue to write Toby Ziegler.*

*If anyone was actually going to get Toby back in the WH Wyatt for president is seemingly the only feasible way I can see that *somewhat believably* happening. Not to mention the much needed ‚Äúfriction‚Äù and ‚Äúconflict‚Äù that would create for Sorkin to use in his typically dialogue heavy screenplays.*

*I can also see Wyatt not only bringing Toby back via the WH residence (which is of course the simplest way to do it, either Andy and Toby married or through the Twins personally either way works for me I love Toby too!) but imo it could even make the argument an easier one if it happens to be made by Wyatt, if anyone can make the argument to the public and the audience that Toby serve‚Äôs as a trusted advisor to any president again it‚Äôs gotta be Andy. Right?*

7.On top of all of that even the flashback-Cameo method could possibly be used a little easier with Andy Wyatt as President, but I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary if they made this choice.  

imo the more I think about this it almost serves (maybe a little to perfectly) all of Sorkins needs to revisit the series. 

I can‚Äôt lie though I personally actually really want to see Sam Sea*Born for president* or Charlie Young as president. I just think Andy is the much more feasible option here. "

I just don‚Äôt understand why she says it that way and it bothers me probably more than it should. Anyone else have an opinion?

561,"A Conversation About Sorkin So I wanted to get some other folks opinion regarding my opinion of Aaron Sorkin.  First off, I'm a huge fan of almost everything he has done.  My IPad is littered with his movies, his TV shows, etc.  I probably have watched more of his stuff than any other screenwriter out there.  There is something that does bother me with his writing though.

I've been watching a lot of his movies lately.  Molly's Game, The Social Network, Moneyball and Jobs specifically.  All of these are movies I really like but there is one issue I have with them and it is the artistic license he seems to take with real people, ones that are also still alive.  My examples are below (and maybe I'm wrong about a few so please correct me where I am wrong):

- Moneyball:  That movie made Art Howe look really bad and he was not that against the Moneyball approach according to him.  Art has had to defend himself in print about this which I think is incredibly unfair.  Make Reese from The Newsroom look bad, fine.  Make a real person look bad when they weren't, I have an issue with that.Also, it's not as if the A's didn't already still have all-star pitching.  

- Molly's Game:  I'm totally fine with the Idris Elba being the ""eyes of the audience"" and not being real.  However, from what I understand is that Molly's main accident didn't occur the way it was depicted in the film.  The main motivation of her going to LA is based upon a false presence, which is fine in a made up story but it's hard to keep with that in a ""based on a true story"".    Also, the conversation with the father (I love Coestner in this film) never happened.  

- Jobs:  Again, my understanding is that all of the fights/arguments before the presentations never happened and the feelings of Steve W and others were misrepresented.  

Again, I'm a huge fan of Sorkin but it's these items just seem like plot devices and are not true to the story.

Anyway else agree or am I nuts?"
562,"Favorite Comedic Moments? Some of the best comedic moments off the top of my head are:

568,"Eppur Si Muove - a failure to follow up? The recent discussion of the Bartlet sisters had me thinking about ""Eppur Si Muove"", and the writers failing to follow up on it.  In a sense, I recognize they \*had\* to ignore the ramifications in order to generate the drama of the next year, but these lines: 

WILL You're going to need to tell the President, sir.  

RUSSELL Am I?  

WILL It's going to come out, sir. The list is all over town.  

RUSSELL Well, maybe that's not so bad. It wasn't my plan, but it might be a happy accident. Just the thing we need to put a little distance between us and them. I wouldn't worry about.

If the story that the Vice President leaked information that put Ellie in the cross hairs had come out, the Russell campaign would have been dead in the water.  Russell would have been frozen out by President Bartlet.  

I don't blame them for dropping the story line, and I generally enjoy the episode (particularly the Sesame Street bits, it even made me tolerate Elmo), but it's hanging there.  That Russell was that arrogant and stupid, he really didn't deserve the nomination."

575,"West Wing Spinoff Ideas I was bored and I thought of a bunch of West Wing spinoff ideas.  Would you watch any of them?

&amp;#x200B;

**Keyworth**

Follows the psychiatric practice of Dr. Stanley Keyworth.  Each episode would be a session with a client.  If you've ever seen ""In Treatment"" with Gabriel Byrne, something like that.

**Tribbey &amp; Babbish**

Lionel Tribbey and Oliver Babbish, two former WH counsels, have started a law firm together in their post-political days.  They are the managing partners, and they have brought in Charlie Young(now a lawyer), and a stable of WW recurring characters - Ainsley Hayes, Cliff Calley, Joe Quincy, and Laurie(Sam's friend who was in law school) - for the firm.  Yeah, it's an unrealistic premise, but I have no doubt it would be good with all those characters as regulars.  Basically a lawyer show, but with potential to be more.

**Political Science 101**

Over a decade after he left the WH in scandal, this would follow Toby Ziegler as a professor of Political Science at Columbia.  Andy(still his ex-wife) and his now-college-age children Molly and Tuck would make regular appearances.  I guess his father Jules could also make an appearance or two, but Jerry Adler is 90 now, so I don't know.

We would see Toby lecturing his classes(plenty of opportunity for those great Toby monologues), dealing with students one-on-one, as a father, etc.  This would be a sort of quiet character piece about Toby.  Maybe a guest appearance now and then from former WWers, but for the most part, it would be just Toby.

**Red Lights**

Follows Josh and Donna as, post-Santos administration, they start a political consultancy firm, as full partners, and as husband and wife.

**Dr. Bartlet**

A hospital show with Dr. Eleanor ""Ellie"" Bartlet as the main character.

&amp;#x200B;

(A pair of prequels here, which would obviously need recasting for key roles)

**The Young Jed Bartlet**

This would follow Bartlet's years at Notre Dame.  Think of the flashbacks in ""Two Cathedrals"", except he's in college now.  That aesthetic.  We'd see him meet and begin a courtship with young Abbey, we'd see him studying economics and ditching his plans to be a priest, we'd find a way for young Mrs. Landingham to be there, maybe some appearances from Jed's dad.  Just the formative years of the future president.

**Hampshire**

This would follow Bartlet's years as governor of New Hampshire.  Aside from following all the political goings-on in New Hampshire(maybe there could be some run-ins with President Lassiter), we'd also see him develop his friendship with Leo(maybe we'd also see Leo as Secretary of Labor), we'd see him get diagnosed with MS, we'd see his daughters when they were younger, etc.  The final scene of the final episode would be the flashback from ""Bartlet For America"", where Leo comes to Bartlet's house and asks him to run for President.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Supremes**

This one's hardly original, but a show focusing on the SCOTUS with Evelyn Baker Lang, Christopher Mulready, and seven other fictional justices.

**Mandyville(Half joking here, but...)**

In which we find Mandy Hampton waking up from a coma she's been in for twenty years after having been shot in ""What Kind Of Day Has It Been?"".  At first we watch her re-orient herself to the world after having missed two decades, and then, after a while, pissed off, go looking for Josh and CJ to find out why nobody seemed to care or even notice that she was gone."

581,"Who‚Äôs your Mrs Morello? In the season 3 episode ‚ÄúStirred‚Äù, Donna learns her favorite high school teacher, Mrs Morello, is retiring. She bugs Josh all episode, hoping to get a proclamation for Mrs Morello, with Josh repeatedly turning her down. Being the softy that he is, however, leads him to to write a memo to the President who later calls Mrs Morello. 

It‚Äôs one of the sweetest moments of the series and one of my favorites all around. https://youtu.be/InJ23OG7sn8

Donna tells Mrs Morello that it‚Äôs because of her that she is standing in the Oval Office. 

So I ask you all, who‚Äôs your Mrs Morello? Who got you to where you are and, if given the opportunity, would look to call and thank when they retire. 

Mine, too, was my high school English teacher. Because of him, my love for reading was rekindled; I am a better writer because of it; I pursued English lit in college and while I may work in insurance I still use that critical thinking and analysis. More importantly though he taught us to look at things from different angles, literally and figuratively, as he let four dorky kids film short movies for our final or reviewed The Crucible through a modern lens of discrimination. So, Mr Hashemian, if you‚Äôre reading this (and I like to believe you‚Äôre a fan of Sorkin), Thank You. I might not be standing in the Oval Office but you certainly helped me be successful in life.

583,"Would the ‚ÄúMandy‚Äù character have worked if she was portrayed by Janel Moloney? I started a rewatch of the series and I‚Äôm showing it to my mom for her first time. No matter how many times I‚Äôve seen these episodes, I‚Äôm still shocked to see Mandy in the Pilot. Then today I had this random shower thought: Janel Moloney‚Äôs natural chemistry with Bradley Whitford overpowered what ever was supposed to happen between Josh and Mandy, and essentially replaced Moira Kelly.

Not trying to shit on Moira Kelly, she‚Äôs a fine actress, but some people cannot speak Sorkin‚Äôs words the they‚Äôre meant to be said (pretentious, I know, but Exhibit A: The Newsroom). Mandy was supposed to be Josh‚Äôs ‚Äúend-game‚Äù love interest but Janel and Brad just *worked* together, creating the inevitability of Josh and Donna‚Äôs romantic relationship. Then I got to thinking, if Mandy was played by Janel, would she have lasted and been more likable?

Janel naturally fit into Sorkin‚Äôs world and was able to land herself a permanent spot on the show, but Moira went through just the opposite. Unfortunately, Moira made Mandy an unbearable character. Janel is obviously capable of playing someone with a strong personality like Mandy‚Äôs (campaign/Santos Donna) and I imagined that if she played Mandy, Mandy could have been a character we love to hate. Janel and Brad‚Äôs ability to go back and forth, something he and Moira lacked, also would have brought a likability to Mandy. 

The show would be completely different if this happened. Even if Moira Kelly stayed on the show, what would Mandy even have done? She was always the ‚Äúoutsider‚Äù character and never really fit in with the rest of the staff.

Anyway, sorry if this is confusing and ramble-y but I‚Äôm curious to see what other people think of this. 

Edit: I‚Äôd imagine this scenario also including the Donna character, played by somebody else, and being more of the secondary/minor recurring character she was intended to be (like Ginger, Carol, etc.)."
584,Just finished the series all the way through for the first time. What do I do now? 
585,"‚Ä¢Angela Blake ‚Ä¢Kate Harper ‚Ä¢Ryan Pierce ‚Ä¢Rina ‚Ä¢Joe Quincy ....... What was with the massive amount of new and almost all useless characters who were introduced with their own ‚Äúmini-arc‚Äù in S5 alone? 

 ‚Ä¢Angela Blake ‚Ä¢Ryan Pierce ‚Ä¢Rina ‚Ä¢Roy Ashland ‚Ä¢Greg Brock ‚Ä¢Jeff Haffley  ‚Ä¢General Alexander ‚Ä¢Kate Harper just to name a few.  

I mean sure some were definitely necessary, specifically I can see ‚Ä¢Ashland, ‚Ä¢Haffley ‚Ä¢General Alexander (*I guess? but I will always prefer Fitzwallace*) and maybe ‚Ä¢Brock (*since he was pretty much the Danny Concannon replacement, although I don‚Äôt remember why Timothy Busfield couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt appear in S5*) but the sheer total of MandyVille retirees that appear in S5 alone seems ridiculous and unnecessary to me. 

At a minimum I‚Äôd say ‚Ä¢Angela Blake ‚Ä¢Rina ‚Ä¢Joe Quincy (*who by all accounts seems to be the actual intended S5 Token Mandy replacement introduced in late S4, but Im sure I could be wrong about this*) and ‚Ä¢Ryan Pierce all seem to fit this bill.  

This season definitely introduced most of my all time least favorite characters. That Top spots currently a tie for me between ‚Ä¢Angela Blake (*Since I will always stick by Josh Lyman and who I possibly irrationally resent because of the way she really made Leo come of as adversarial during this arc*) and ‚Ä¢Kate Harper (*She just wasn‚Äôt needed! Nancy McNally still appeared in these seasons why introduce her at all? Plus as irrational as it may seem I do blame her directly and almost solely for causing Leo‚Äôs heart attack*). Although Mandy will still always maintain a top placement on that list. 

Did this swarm of needless and endless introduction of new characters in S5 bring anyone else‚Äôs least favorite along with it?

I completely understand and also agree with those who will say that they think the California 47th campaign really hurts him or even that it completely disqualifies him here, but I‚Äôd counter that argument with the fact that by this point in the series timeline Sam Seaborn would‚Äôve at the very least spent the last 8 years in the Santos administration as Josh Lyman‚Äôs Deputy COS in the WH.  Meaning he would have been a WH insider for over 12 years with plenty of campaign experience under his belt.  He also very likely could‚Äôve taken another run at public office and won.  Just as Will Bailey did when he left the Bartlet WH and was elected to Congress in the Oregon 4th. 

I wonder more and more about this lately not only because of this dialogue from Hartsfield Landing, but also because the entire series was initially designed solely around Sam‚Äôs character as the main protagonist.  This is the most visible in the pilot for the series run, but he remained the protagonist for most if not all of the first season. 

I haven‚Äôt seen this concept or storyline mentioned at all in the many articles confirming Aaron Sorkin is ‚ÄúIn talks of a West Wing reboot‚Äù 

I enjoy all of The West Wing characters and I agree there are numerous ways this new plot can develop, but am I really the only one wondering this? 

I‚Äôve also wondered this same thing about Charlie Young‚Äôs character.  Although there was not any right on the nose dialogue to support this specific theory, I do feel there was definitely enough subtle foreshadowing throughout the series run to support this Character development.  Although I would agree that If Charlie married Zoey it could make this storyline somewhat less believable and at a minimum more difficult to explore and write. "
590,"Evidence of Things Not Seen Yet another mistake with regard to military decorations. At around 16:13 there's a shot of Will Bailey in his Air Force uniform, and his ribbons are pinned on upside down. My love for this series knows no bounds, but as a veteran of the United States Air Force, these mistakes really annoy me.

There are several of these issues throughout the show, all of them having to do with military medals and ribbons either being pinned on the wrong way or being misrepresented by the writers. I really wish the producers would have paid closer attention to these important (however minuscule) details. It just makes me feel like they said, ""Okay, let's just slap some ribbons on the costume. It doesn't really matter if they're on correctly. We don't have time to worry about that."" This isn't a parody. The actors are wearing exact replicas of uniforms worn by members of our armed forces, and they should be represented correctly.

608,"I ran like Leo (long rant) One of my closest friends was in a freak accident yesterday. He was driving along with his father and out of nowhere a metal rod fell loose from a truck, pierced the windshield and lodged itself in his skull, going completely through it.
Somehow he survived, but he's in a deep coma, and after a delicate three hour extraction from the car wreck they have been operating on him for nine hours straight.
I was a groomsman at his wedding, and his wife, also one of my closest friends, was my godmother (I was only baptized at 27, having grown up in a non-religious left-wing family).
As soon as I heard about the accident I ran out of the government office I work in (I'm a political operative, and everyone was very caring and understanding, thankfully), and got in an uber bound for the hospital.
They're only thirty-one years old like myself, and just got a beautiful baby boy eight months ago to join their lovely one-and-a-half year old blond girl. The kids are at home with their grandmother, and once I got to the hospital and did my clumsy best at comforting her, I tried to get through to some of my medical connections to see if we could get some unofficial information on his condition (doctors will often only inform relatives once they've got something conclusive).
He's in a deep coma and we don't know how long it'll take for him to come back, but thankfully it seems any brain damage was minor, in what can only be described as a miracle within a tragedy.
After a while hospital staff politely asked us non-relatives to leave, so we went outside and kept our vigil throughout the night.
Now it's three a.m. and we're freezing our asses off but everyone refuses to leave until we hear how the operation went. It's mighty cold here in Europe in peak winter, but thank God I brought my trusty winter coat, West-Wing style.
Finally some family members come down and tell us the operation went well, but it'll take some time for us to know the full results. Everyone is relieved, for as small as they might seem at this point, every good news count. Then they tell us he's in ICU, and that our friend's wife (my best friend and godmother) insisted on seeing him before going home to soothe her children, even in this mangled state.
We panic, for we know as strong and brave as she is, it'll be a sight that might break her. So we scramble to the various exits hoping to catch her as she leaves, and make sure she gets home safe.
I'm walking towards my assigned exit as one of our friends calls me saying she was spotted coming my way, and I start to pick-up speed, going from a fast walk to a full-on sprint, not in an instant (don't ask me why, I guess my brain wasn't fully there yet after all the tribulations of that day) but rather slowly, so I literally do the ""Leo run"" from the season 4 finale, stopping at last in front of the hospital door panting, just in time to hug my best friend and godmother on the hardest night of her life.

*EDIT 2: I will post the final totals later today and start Season 3 then.*

*EDIT 3: So 'Two Cathedrals' did end up on top but the voting was much closer than I think we expected.  (I only ended up using ballots with at least 3 episodes).   6 episodes received no votes (including 'The Portland Trip' which I found surprising.  I really like that one.)*

*'Two Cathedrals' ended up in first with 65 points.*  Right behind in second was 'Noel' with 61.  It actually had more total votes but 'Cathedrals' had so many first place votes it ended up on top.  Third place was 'In The Shadow of Two Gunman' with 56.  Those three really did separate themselves.  Fourth was '17 People' at 37; Fifth was basically a three way tie between 'Galileo', 'The Stackhouse Filibuster' and 'Somebody's Going To Emergency‚Ä¶'.  The total votes are below.*

611,"Help Me find a Toby rant. Hello every one,  This is my first post on Reddit.  Who knew you guys were here.  I need your help.  and I am sort of under the time pressure thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for the video clip or episode where Toby pulls all the aids together and goes off on them for leaking something to press.  One of he lines was something like, ...""everyone wants to be the guy in the know, the one who has the skinny, the inside story""

&amp;#x200B;

I have a team that I work with that this is would be a perfect  clip to play for them since some important information has been leaked out of our office.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone knows what I am looking for please reply or send me a PM.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance and I am glad I found you....

612,"Bartlet's Daughters I saw in comments of another post that there might not be much love for Ellie for some people, but for me, she was my favourite Bartlet sister. Even though she doesn't have a ton of appearances (just for reference, Liz has 6, Ellie has 9, and Zoey has 25) she does have an arc and I think I find her the most believable out of the three characters. 

It's kinda hard to judge Liz as a character; I'd say 4 of her 6 appearances (7A, Dogs of War, Abu el Banat, and Requiem) were little more than cameos. The only storyline she had was in season 6 when her ass of a husband was running for Congress and when he was having an affair (both minor plots). I mean she clearly wanted to stay out of the spotlight and was both mature and smart enough to do so. Sure she had a questionable choice for a husband but she made her father's life easier by not adding to his troubles. 

As for Zoey, I did like her, don't get me wrong, but I found the whole hanging out with questionable characters (Jean-Paul) and not taking her secret service protection seriously in season 4 (even though her father had been shot 4 years prior), was kinda cliche. We don't see much character  development, even though she appears in 25 episodes (sure she was far from a  main character so I wouldn't have expected a ton of development but we see more development in Ellie in much fewer appearances).

Maybe it's the middle child in me, but I always found myself identifying more with Ellie. She did not want anything to do with her father's career choice and does a good job at staying out of it, except when she wants to stand up for someone she supports (when she spoke out in support of the Surgeon General). In Ellie we see her very distant to her father, yet in the last season we see her willing to have a White House wedding when she very easily could have eloped or done something quieter."

630,"Let's talk assistants, particularly Donna... I like the character, she's great and her banter with Josh is fun. But the emphasis on Donna over all the other assistants has always seemed a bit out of place for me. She is often present or involved in things that none of the other assistants are. 

An example...when they gather at the inaugural ball for the president to make Will Bailey officially part of the staff, she is the only one there (besides Charlie who is there actually helping the president) that is not senior staff. Where's Ginger? She's the communication assistant.

Another one off the top of my head...when senior staff meets for breakfast... Margaret is there with Leo, which makes perfect sense to me as he's COS. But the only other assistant present is Donna. Where's Carol? Where's Ginger?

One more...in 20 Hours In America. She's the only assistant that traveled on the campaign? Why did she go at all? None of the other senior staff assistants went.

636,"Process Stories/Inauguration: Part 1 - Jack Reese's Military Decorations [SPOILER] for anyone not past S04E07

In keeping with the theme from my post on Adm. Fitzwallace's medals, there are yet more errors in conjunction with the use of military decorations that should be pointed out, but these are far more obvious. Jumping ahead to ""Inauguration: Part 1"", during the scene when Donna lets Josh know that the tickets for the balls came, she shows off her knowledge (or lack thereof) about Jack's dress blues and lists his decorations. The line is, ""Warfare pin, submarine officer pin, two commendation medals, meritorious unit, purple heart, bronze cross and a saber.""

We'll begin with the fact that amongst the long list of U.S. military decorations, there is no such thing as a ""bronze cross"". There is the bronze star and the purple heart, neither of which Jack possesses. Going back to ""Process Stories"", we can clearly see Jack's ribbon rack and his insignias. They are as follows - Navy achievement (not commendation) medal (x1) with a ""V"" for valor, meritorious unit commendation (x1), Navy ""E"" ribbon (x1), Navy &amp; Marine Corps overseas service ribbon (x1), submarine officer warfare insignia and his Joint Chiefs of Staff identification badge, which is worn by staff and support personnel assigned to the Office of the Chairman and the Joint Staff. The only one she was correct about was his meritorious unit commendation, because when she said ""warfare pin, submarine officer pin"", the line was clearly written to indicate two separate pins. There is only one pin for submarine officer and enlisted personnel, and that is the submarine warfare insignia, or ""fish"", that is awarded after extensive training on all the boat's systems. Gold denotes officer, silver denotes enlisted. The others Donna speaks of (besides the non-existent bronze cross) are clearly not on his rack.

By the way, for the sake of anyone who might think I'm attempting to trash the show, please be aware that I'm in the camp of those who think this is the greatest TV show ever produced. Speaking ill of our beloved TWW is not my intent. But I'm also a veteran of the U.S. Air Force and a stickler for continuity, and have always been disappointed with the surprising lack of attention the producers sometimes paid to matters of military uniform continuity. Perhaps they thought the show would never be watched again after the first airing and that no one would catch these little details. But when they wrote Donna's line, which I quoted at the top of the post, all they needed to do was go back and quickly look at the two or three seconds of the scene in Jack's office and take note of the decorations they adorned his uniform with. Taking the time to do a little due diligence wouldn't have cost them anything. And before anyone brings it up, I already checked his oval office scene in Arctic Radar, and no change was made to his decorations between the two episodes. "

642,"Ranking Characters: The Regulars So, over a year ago I started this project of ranking characters.  In late 2017 I posted the one-offs, sometime in Spring 2018 I posted the 2-4 recurring episode thread, then late last summer I posted the 5-10 episode recurring and 11+ episode recurring threads in close proximity to each other.  All of those lists garnered positive reception(though the most recent 11+ episode recurring one garnered some rather heated disagreement over my placement of Ainsley Hayes(she was #10 overall, not that low!) and even Bob Russell).

If don't remember or weren't around when those threads were posted, here are the links to the previous posts, to refresh your memory - maybe have a look:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/92q7xb/ranking\_characters\_11\_episode\_recurring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/92q7xb/ranking_characters_11_episode_recurring/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/915jha/ranking\_characters\_510\_episode\_recurring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/915jha/ranking_characters_510_episode_recurring/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/8eznao/ranking\_characters\_24\_episode\_recurring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/8eznao/ranking_characters_24_episode_recurring/) [https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/6ydxfk/ranking\_characters\_the\_oneoffs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/6ydxfk/ranking_characters_the_oneoffs/)

Anyway, I got sidetracked with other things so it's been a while, but today I'm posting the final installment of the project.  This has taken me a while to write.  I mean, it's a hell of a lot of writing, so I hope someone actually takes the time to read it all.  Most probably won't.  Oh well.

I'm actually posting two lists here.  The first will be a brief list ranking and acknowledging some of what we'll call the non-credited regulars - characters who are seen on a regular basis but are never seen in the credits - these are mostly assistants, but there are a couple of others as well.

The second list will be the main one, the fifteen characters who have appeared in the opening credits, with much more writing than the first list.

Without further ado...

# Non-Credited Regulars

**8. Cathy / Portrayed by Suzy Nakamura**

**Appeared in 9 episodes, Season 1**

Cathy was an additional assistant that Sam had for nine episodes in the first season, after which she went to Mandyville.  She is often forgotten in conversations like this.  Not much say to really.

**7. Nancy / Portrayed by Renee Estevez**

**Appeared in 44 episodes, seasons 1-7**

Played by Martin Sheen's daughter, Nancy was a direct assistant to the President, seen every now and then coming in and out of whatever room he's in to tell him that so-and-so is here or such-and-such wants to speak to him, among other things.

**6. White House Press Corp reporters Katie Witt, Mark O'Donnell, Steve, and Chris / Portrayed by Kris Murphy, Timothy Davis-Reed, Charles Noland, and Mindy Seeger**

**Katie Witt appeared in 53 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

**Mark O'Donnell appeared in 43 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

**Steve appeared in 52 episodes, Seasons 2-7**

**Chris appeared in 34 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

Ok, so these are the four - and I think they're the only ones - press corp reporters that appear regularly with dialogue.  I felt it was important to acknowledge them because having some familiar faces in the press room throughout adds continuity and makes the show feel more realistic in those scenes.  I've included the four of them together instead of individually because none of them has enough screen time to have gotten to know any of them, but together they should be acknowledged.  If you don't know who they are by name, here are some photos to jog your memory(Steve and Chris don't have last names because they don't have last names on iMDB):

**5. Bonnie / Portrayed by Devika Parikh**

**Appeared in 41 episodes, Seasons 1-5**

One of two long-term assistants in the communications office who served Toby and Sam(and later Will).  Always being given many order, always dependable.  Disappeared for some reason in the post-Sorkin years.

**4. Ed &amp; Larry / Portrayed by Peter James Smith and William Duffy**

**Appeared in 47/48 episodes, respectively, Seasons 1-7**

I feel like Ed &amp; Larry existed because while Toby had people who reported directly to him(Sam, C.J., Will), Josh never did, outside of Donna.  They were there to make it look like there were other people working under Josh.

So they're often seen in meetings about legislative-type things, they seem competent enough, and they're funny too from time to time.

**3. Ginger / Portrayed by Kim Webster**

**Appeared in 58 Episodes, Seasons 1-7**

The other long-term assistant in the communications office.  I've always felt that Kim Webster really gave Ginger a good deal of personality in her relatively limited screen time.  She always seemed feisty, unintimidated, not afraid to give Toby some lip from time to time.  I always liked her.

**2. Carol Fitzpatrick / Portrayed by Melissa Fitzgerald**

**Appeared in 102 Episodes, Seasons 1-7**

C.J.'s right-hand in the press office(still seen but less so after C.J. becomes chief of staff), she was always such a positive person, happy to be there, and uber-competent at her job as well.  Always liked that her and C.J. seemed to have a genuine friendship.  Seems like everybody likes Carol.

**1. Margaret Hooper / Portrayed by NiCole Robinson**

**Appeared in 106 episodes, Seasons 1-7**

The obvious #1 here.  The executive assistant to the chief of staff under both Leo and C.J., Margaret was a wonderfully kooky, offbeat character(NiCole Robinson deserves all the credit in the world for bringing her to life).  Her eccentric demeanor can sometimes mask the fact that she is as good as anybody could be at her job, that Leo and C.J. would be lost without her, and that she cares deeply about her bosses and her job.  I think C.J. got right to the point with this bit of dialogue:

&gt;You're an odd woman.  I've never understood you.  But you're extremely capable.  You run this office like a watch.  You're tall, which is reassuring.  Leo may need you, and if he does, that's okay.  But if he's willing to part with you, I hope you'll stay.

Margaret is as memorable is any other character.

And now the final list...

# The Regulars

And we reach the final list of the project.

As an aside, it's never easy to put characters in an order like this, much less the *main* characters.  Some decisions were easier than others.  The top seven in particular was murderously difficult to put in order, aside from the top two which were a given to me at the outset.  All of these characters are so great, it hurts to put anyone lower than they might have been.  But I figure there's no order I can put them in that won't piss somebody off, so I may as well just put them in the order I feel is right, which after much deliberation and mind-changing, is exactly what I have done.  Without further ado...

**15. Mandy Hampton / Portrayed by Moira Kelly**

**Appeared In: 20 Episodes(+2 credit-only), Season 1**

**Title: White House Media Consultant, Season 1**

As if it was going to be anybody else at #15.  Moira Kelly is a great actress, I don't think anyone has ever blamed her, but the character just was not likable.  She didn't fit in.  The show was an idealistic, aspirational view of government, and in the Sorkin years(it was different post-Sorkin), the conflict was always between Bartlet's staff and whoever was opposing them.  It was them against the world.  That dynamic was essential to what made the show what it was.  Having someone inside the team constantly arguing with and antagonizing other members of the team didn't work.

Additionally, she just came across as a shallow person.  She seemed to always care more about how something looked or how something would play than about what the administration was actually doing.  Yes, her job was as a media consultant, but C.J.'s job dealt with the media as well and she always cared 100% as much about the real stuff as she did about how it played, hell, she probably cared MORE about the real stuff.

The character just didn't work well.  Although I've never been a fan of characters just disappearing without explanation.

**14. Kate Harper / Portrayed by Mary McCormack**

**Appeared In: 30 Episodes(+18 credit-only), Seasons 5-7**

**Title: Deputy National Security Advisor, Seasons 5-7**

IIRC, Kate was not a very popular character at the time, when the Post-Sorkin seasons were first airing, but has maybe grown a little in popularity over the years.

There are several issues with Kate, IMO.

One is that, like Mandy, she is more of a pragmatist in a world populated with idealists.  Bartlet's staff were all, to varying degrees, passionate and partisan, and would breathe fire to defend their convictions.  In contrast, Kate was not a politician or a political operative, having come from a military/defense background, and would often come off as colder and more dispassionate.  I just felt like it didn't jive a lot of the time.

Another is that she essentially ended up replacing the far superior character of Nancy McNally.  Nancy appears in 20 episodes total, and ""Talking Points"", in which she introduces Kate to Bartlet(and us) near the end of season 5, is the 17th.  She only appeared in three more episodes in the following two seasons.  Any time Nancy would've ordinarily been there, Kate is there instead.  If that was the intent, I can't support it.

To me, after many re-watches, it just seems to me that Wells and his team knew ahead of time that Josh was going to leave the WH in season 6, that Leo was going to be in a reduced role, that Will was going to be on the campaign trail a lot, and that with basically only Bartlet, C.J., and Toby left, they simply needed another character to be in the WH as a regular.  With a few exceptions(the middle east peace summit at the beginning of season 6), her plots were usually filler and not all that important.

**13. Annabeth Schott / Portrayed by Kristin Chenoweth**

**Appeared In: 23 Epsiodes(+11 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: Deputy Press Secretary, Season 6**

**Aide to Democratic Vice-Presidential Candidate Leo McGarry, Season 7**

Annabeth would've been higher on this list if she'd appeared in more episodes.  Kristen Chenoweth has a magnetic personality, and she succeeds in the delicate balancing act of making the character so relentlessly upbeat and bright and positive without being annoying.  It's impossible not to like her.

Yet, despite the happy nature of the character, her most memorable and effective scene is easily in the hospital in ""Election Day, Part 2"", when, her face drenched in tears, she informs Josh(and us) that Leo McGarry has passed on.  Chenoweth killed it in that scene.

I want to rank her higher, but as likable as she is, her role just wasn't substantial enough to put any higher.

**12. Will Bailey / Portrayed by Joshua Malina**

**Appeared In: 71 Episodes(+9 credit-only), Seasons 4-7**

**Title: White House Deputy Director Of Communications, Season 4**

**Chief Of Staff to the Vice-President Of The United States, Season 5**

**Campaign Manager, Russell Campaign, Season 6**

**White House Director Of Communications, Season 7**

Will is perhaps the most frustrating character on this list, and I struggled with where to place him.  The Will of season 4 is a genuinely likable guy, a little aloof, a little in over his head, but a good guy, super intelligent, hard worker, awed by where he finds himself, working in the White House.

But his character was essentially sacrificed in season 5 - the awed, aloof guy who believed in certain principles enough to get a dead guy elected, who excelled at speechwriting, turned into an ambition-driven operative in order to set him up as Russell's campaign manager and Josh's foil in the season 6 primaries.   And then in season 7, he's almost an afterthought, his most memorable moments being his ascension to the title of White House Director Of Communications after Toby's firing, and his much-maligned romance with Kate(it was a decent idea on paper, but they had no chemistry).

Malina is a good actor - anything that went wrong with the character was not his fault at all - and when I see Will in his good moments, it frustrates me because of what he could've been, but his bad moments, when he's reduced to acting so punk-ish to Josh and so forth because the plot calls for it, are enough to drag him down this low.

**11. Matthew ""Matt"" Santos / Portrayed by Jimmy Smits**

**Appeared In: 35 Episodes(+2 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: United States Congressman From Texas, Season 6**

**Democratic Nominee for President Of The United States/President-Elect Of The United States, Season 7**

I think both of the season 6-7 candidate characters were well-written and well-performed, and had either of them existed for longer than 1.5 seasons, they'd probably rank higher on the list, but they were only around for a small slice of the show, so I can't see ranking either any higher than this - though they were always going to be at the top of 10-15 range, as they are pretty easily the best-written and best-performed and most important of those characters.

I put Santos one rung lower than Vinick, and the reason will be clear in the Vinick write-up.  For right now, I'll just say what I like about Santos.

The character was conceived shortly after Obama's 2004 convention speech.  He was based on Obama and, some might say, in turn had some influence on the 2008 election in which Obama was elected in real life.  The character was supposed to have many of the same characteristics as the real Obama - young, charismatic, unabashedly liberal, etc.

Santos displayed two traits throughout the campaign - integrity and insecurity.  Integrity in that he didn't want to do an attack ad in ""Freedonia"", in that he didn't initially want to make a photo-op out of his service as a military reserve, integrity in turning Russell's VP offer down, integrity in not bowing out at the convention because ""it's not my place to decide who the nominee should be.  That decision is yours and yours alone"".  Also, if you believe the story he told Vinick(and I see no reason not to), he displayed integrity in stepping up to support his irresponsible brother's child because it was the right thing to do.

He was insecure about his ability to play the game of presidential politics, especially at the beginning - there were a number of occasions in which Josh would have to teach Santos how to play the game, and Santos would express frustration at having to do what in his view were such trivial things instead of talking about real issues that mattered.

I appreciated his willingness and determination to hold onto his integrity in the face of losing, of not being comfortable with the game of presidential politics until he could figure out how to play it on his own terms.

In terms of policy, he was an ideal liberal, and nowhere was that more front-and-center than in the debate episode, in which he advocated for medicare-for-all, green energy, public education, and more, and put a bow on it with his defense of the liberal label:

&gt;Yes, a liberal Republican, Senator. What happened to them? They got run out of your party. What did liberals do that was so offensive to the liberal party? I'll tell you what they did. Liberals got women the right to vote. Liberals got African-Americans the right to vote. Liberals created Social Security and lifted millions of elderly people out of poverty. Liberals ended segregation. Liberals passed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act. Liberals created Medicare. Liberals passed the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act. What did Conservatives do? They opposed them on every one of those things,   every one. So when you try to hurl that label at my feet, 'Liberal,' as if it were something to be ashamed of, something dirty, something to run away from, it won't work, Senator, because I will pick up that label and I will wear it as a badge of honor.

Matt Santos was a great, charismatic character, a beacon of liberalism, and shares many qualities with Obama, whom I consider to be the one of the greatest presidents we've had.  So why is he above Vinick?  Read on.

**10. Arnold Vinick / Portrayed by Alan Alda**

**Appeared In: 18 Episodes(+10 credit-only), Seasons 6-7**

**Title: United States Senator From California, Season 6**

**Republican Nominee for President Of The United States/Secretary Of State-Designate, Season 7**

So why Vinick above Santos?  Because Vinick is a Republican whose politics I vehemently disagree with and who I would never vote for against any decently capable Democrat, but who I still like a great deal, and I know many share that opinion.  To create such a character on a show dominated by very vocal liberals and Democrats, whose audience is mostly very liberal, is, from both a writing and acting standpoint, simply a heavier lift than to create a character like Santos.  It's that simple.

From a writing standpoint, to create a moderate Republican, a liberal Republican, a pro-choice Republican from California, was a great contrast to the rightward lurch the party was experiencing and continues to experience in real life.  To use the platform to show what a Republican used to be and what it still could be was ingenious.

From an acting standpoint, they hit a home run with Alda.  I mean, Jimmy Smits is a very good actor.  He is.  But Alda is a legendary actor, a national treasure.  He played the character note-perfectly, made him a three-dimensional, complicated, genuine, well-intentioned, downright warm, person.  I really don't think the character would've worked nearly as well as it did or been liked as much as he was in the hands of a lesser actor.  Alda is probably the #1 reason I'm ranking Vinick this high.

I'd also mention that, like Santos, Vinick was also a man of great integrity.  When Bruno found Santos's briefcase and gave it to Vinick, a lot of candidates would've ran with it, but what did Vinick do?  He set up a meeting with Santos, gave him a chance to explain himself, took him at his word, and didn't use it.  In ""The Al Smith Dinner"", he ultimately chose to denounce the ad attacking Santos's pro-choice position even though it would've scored him points with the right wing, because it would've been disingenuous on his part not to.  In ""In God We Trust"", he declined to go to church because it would've been phony:

&gt;Look, I respect Reverend Butler.  And I respect his church too much to use it for my own political purposes.  And That's exactly what I'd be doing if I went down there this Sunday.  Because the truth is, it would just be an act of political phoniness.  I may be wrong but I suspect our churches already have enough political phonies in them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Senator, do you or do you not--?  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't see how we can have a separation of church and state in this government if you have to pass a religious test to get in this government.  And I wanna warn everyone in the press and all the voters out there.  If you demand expressions of religious faith from politicians, you are just begging to be lied to.  They won 't all lie to you, but a lot of them will, and it'll be the easiest lie they ever had to tell to get your votes.  So every day until the end of this campaign, I'll answer any question anyone has on government.  But if you have a question on religion, please, go to church.  Thank you.

Finally, in ""Election Day, Part 2"", after receiving news of Leo's death, Vinick's advisors tell him he should challenge a Santos win on grounds of tainted electors in the wake of Leo's passing.  Vinick refuses to use Leo's death that way:

&gt;How about creating a conscience for ourselves? I've known Leo for 20 years.  Can we please not use him as a step stool?

Aside from all of that, I thought both the writers and Alda did a great job of showing the humanity within the politician, particularly towards the end - when he got sick from shaking so many hands, and then after the election, in ""The Last Hurrah"", when we get to see go overnight from almost being president to being, relatively speaking, no one.

He was just a great, thought-provoking character, despite being politically the opposite of me and most of the show's audience.

*Here is a demarcation point.  I consider all of the characters ahead to be the 'core' cast.  They are 'the family'.  The characters 15-10 are not 'in the family', not even Will.  These are the characters who were there from beginning to end(even if it took Charlie a couple episodes to appear and even if Sam was gone for a few years).*

**9. Charlie Young / Portrayed by Dule Hill**

**Appeared in 131 Episodes(+6 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: Personal Aide to the President, Seasons 1-6**

**Deputy Special Assistant/Aide to the White House Chief Of Staff, Seasons 6-7**

Charlie was an improbable character - a college-age kid whose father wasn't in his life, whose mother was killed, who at such a young age was thrust into being the primary guardian over his younger sister, who then later on became the target of an act of terror.  You might think that such a person might be hardened, cynical, jaded, but Charlie somehow remains emotionally open.  The combination of that emotional maturity, uncommon intelligence, and general kind demeanor is what defines the character.

Watching this wounded kid take advantage of the opportunity of a lifetime, watching him grow up before our eyes, watching his relationship with Bartlet blossom as they become surrogate father-and-son, watching his on-and-off relationship the first-daughter Zoey, is a joy.

I enjoy his snarkiness from time to time as well.  In ""Shibboleth"" he and Mrs. Landingham have the following exchange about the knife:

&gt;MRS. LANDINGHAM: He's very particular.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE That's one word for it.

In ""Gone Quiet"", he and Bartlet have this conversation:

&gt;BARTLET: That makes sense. Also, there's a chance I could get hit getting on or off.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: \[laughs a little\] Yeah.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Excuse me?  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: Sir?  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: You think I'm not tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One?  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: I think Dikembe Mutombo isn't tall enough to get hit in the neck by the propellers on Marine One.

And in Arctic Radar, after Bartlet screams at the UN Secretary-General about parking tickets, Charlie responds with perfect timing:

&gt;BARTLET: \[screaming\] There are big signs! You can't park there! They should get towed! I hope they get towed to Queens and the Triboro is closed and there's a big craft show at Shea, a flea market or a tractor show!  
&gt;  
&gt;He hangs up.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: Well, that was probably his secretary.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Damn it.  
&gt;  
&gt;CHARLIE: You can bet she'll be parking it in a garage, though.

Charlie's awesome.

**8. Donnatella 'Donna' Moss / Portrayed by Janel Moloney**

**Appeared In 142 Episodes(+8 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: Senior Assistant to the White House Deputy Chief Of Staff, Seasons 1-6**

**Aide/Spokeswoman, Russell Campaign, Season 6**

**Spokeswoman, Santos Campaign, Season 7**

Who doesn't love Donna?

There's her kind, sweet disposition.  Excepting the times Josh annoys her past her breaking point, she always has a warmth about her.  She always has a bright and sunny outlook and always cares for others.  This is evident in the way she always takes care of Josh on a personal level(she's often the only one who can calm him down when he's worked up), how she was all worried in ""The Fall's Gonna Kill You"" about a satellite falling to Earth and potentially hurting people, how she wanted a proclamation for her teacher Mrs. Morello in ""Stirred"", and so on.

She's also highly intelligent, competent, and resourceful.  She is portrayed as kind of flaky sometimes, but I think that's a mirage.  Like in that flashback in ""In The Shadow Of Two Gunmen"" where Donna claims to have had five majors and two minors?  I actually take that to mean she has a degree of intellectual curiosity such that she can't decide which subject to stick with.  This is a person that didn't have the clear path that pretty much every other character on this list other than Charlie did - she didn't go to or graduate from elite schools, she had no big career plan, none of that.  To go from where she was, coming off the street with no degree or experience, to boldly start working for someone who never hired you, to scratch and claw and work so hard and get up where did, doing what she did, you can't do that if you're not a highly intelligent individual.  And over the years she became uber-competent at her job and invaluable to her superiors.

Her girl-next-door looks don't hurt either.

I think Donna had one of the best post-Sorkin arcs, and therefore one of the best overall arcs, of any character, in terms of growth.  While she was uber-competent at her job, over the years she began to feel like she was outgrowing being someone's assistant, like she wanted to do more.  This became an underlying source of tension, as I'm sure Josh at least subconsciously was afraid of losing her, in more ways than one, and thus dragged his feet in terms of giving her opportunity for growth - despite doing it in little ways like sending her to Gaza as part of the model.

So she left him and went out and grew as a person and as a professional before they finally re-connected during the general election, and she got to end her story becoming the chief-of-staff to the incoming first lady.  It's just a satisfying character arc for a good person who deserved good things - she started as a 20-something looking for her place in the world and ended up having found it and then some.

**7. Sam Seaborne / Portrayed by Rob Lowe**

**Appeared In: 80 Episodes(+5 credit-only)**

**Title: White House Deputy Director Of Communications, Seasons 1-4**

**White House Deputy Chief Of Staff-designate, Season 7**

The OG main character.

Sam was a different breed than than Josh and Toby.  Whereas the latter two(and even Leo) went straight into politics, Sam is the only one that actually practiced law.  Perhaps this is why he often seems more level-headed, even-keeled, emotionally adjusted than Josh and Toby, and why his style of argument might seem more disciplined, whereas Josh and Toby use a more impassioned, fiery mode of debate.

Because of all of this, Sam is perhaps more likely to to see the bigger picture in certain cases where Josh and Toby would be more likely to be focused on the trenches in the political fight of the moment.  They live for the political fight, they fight like their lives depend on it.  Sam can certainly get worked up when he wants to, but in general, he's more likely to be pragmatic, to compromise and fight another day.  He doesn't *need* politics the way they do(hence his decision to practice law instead multiple times).

I think they also differ in that Josh and Toby, to quote Bartlet, want to be the guy the guy depends on.  Sam sometimes behaves more like he wants to eventually be the guy.  Maybe that's why Bartlet said he'd be president someday.

Sam is a great character, easily lovable, but because he is, as said before, more emotionally even, even-keeled, outwardly kind, etc, but because he is neither a brooding cauldron of angst and despair like Toby nor a pressure-cooker of feverish restlessness and intensity like Josh, he is actually just a little bit less interesting than them as a character.

**6. Dr. Abigail ""Abbey"" Bartlet / Portrayed by Stockard Channing**

**Appeared In: 57 Episodes(+12 credit-only), Seasons 1-7**

**Title: First Lady Of The United States, Seasons 1-7**

This will probably be the most disagreed-with placement on this list.  I can feel your side-eyes and WTF expressions.

Abbey is, for some reason, a polarizing character.  I, for one, love her.  She is one half of the most believable couple I've ever seen on a TV show, and imo her character elevates Jed and makes him better, while at the same time standing as a formidable woman, a woman to be reckoned with, in her own right.

I've always thought Stockard Channing was magnificent in the role, some of the best work of her career, fully deserving of the Emmy she won for her work in the third season(""Gone Quiet"", ""Dead Irish Writers"").  She really sold the character as a real, breathing person with her own personality, her own considerable mind, her own dreams and regrets and motivations, her own career, who made a big sacrifice with said career for her husband(first by giving up her work, and then by voluntarily giving up her medical license).  She has her own politics, her own disappointments, her own resentments, but above all she loves her husband and her children fiercely.  She has just always felt like such a real, lived character.

I love the arguments between the two of them, how they challenge each other.  Whether it's the showdown in ""The White House Pro-Am"" about Bartlet ""handling"" her, the ""we had a deal"" spat and everything surrounding it in ""Bartlet's Third State of the Union""/""The War At Home"", or the extended argument in ""Manchester"" after he decides to run again, she can stand up to Jed and take him down a peg like no one else, can say things to him that no one else can say, because when it's just the two of them, he's not the president, he's just her husband.  I think it shows a healthy relationship as they don't keep things inside, the duke it out, and more often than not, they end up making up and moving forward.

That's not to discount the more tender moments they share - as you need both the arguments and the tender moments to paint a full and realistic portrait of this couple and this woman.  There are many examples.  Think of the end of ""And It's Surely To Their Credit"" - Bartlet has been clear to be intimate with his wife again after the shooting, but Abbey had punished for making fun of Nellie Bly, so at the episode's conclusion he makes his radio address all about historically important women to atone, and this playful exchange ensues:

&gt;TECHNICIAN: We're out.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Do it live, that's what I always say.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Very nice, babe.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: By the way, sweet knees, the Statue of Liberty.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Get upstairs.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Right there at the front door to the country!  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Get upstairs.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Like a lawn jockey.  
&gt;  
&gt;C.J.: \[comes in\] Mr. President?  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Ah, C.J., the President's going to take a little personal staff time right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: No, it's okay. \[stage whispers\] I'll be right behind you.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Special garment...  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Go.  
&gt;  
&gt;Abbey leaves.

Think of that conversation with Oliver Babbish in ""18th and Potomac"" in which he's urging her not to do the interview with Bartlet, and they argue for a bit, and she finally says to him, in a more vulnerable voice:

&gt;I'd like to be next to my husband when he does this

Or her conversation with Bartlet in the car at the end of Manchester, Part II, in which they make up after being distant all episode:

&gt;BARTLET: Did you know that hardly any of the guys who landed on the moon are married to the same people they were married to before they went there?  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (looks at him, puzzled) What?  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'm just saying it could be worse. I could've been an astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (slightly amused, but concealing it) You could not have been an astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'd have been a great astronaut.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: You're afraid of heights, speed, fire, and small places.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I'd have overcome it to go to the moon.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: (pauses to look at him)I know you would have.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: (pauses to look at her) I'm really happy you're introducing me. I'm really happy about that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Neither one of them says anything for a few moments.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: There's something important I have to say.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Say it.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I haven't really made up my mind yet... but at the moment... I'm leaning towards voting for you.  
&gt;  
&gt;They look at each other for several moments, hints of smiles on their faces.  Then he looks back out the window.

Or her conversation with Bartlet in ""Dead Irish Writers"", in which she tells me she's forfeiting her medical license:

&gt;Bartlet holds out his hand and takes Abbey aside. The band continues to play.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: I called Nolan. I know I shouldn't have, but I'm sorry. The rules are different when it comes to my family. There isn't a man in America who doesn't understand that. I also think partiality isn't a vice in this case. He knows you, and that's a good thing. He's gonna consider not recusing himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I'm gonna voluntarily forfeit my license for the duration of our stay in the White House.  
&gt;  
&gt;Her decision comes as a surprise. Bartlet is speechless. The guests start to sing.  
&gt;  
&gt;GUESTS O, Canada, our home and native land True patriot love in all thy sons' command With glowing hearts, we see thee rise...  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet finally conjures up a response.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Okay. I'm gonna do a toast and everything in a minute, and I'll tell the ditch story, but I wanted to say that I love you very much.  
&gt;  
&gt;Abbey is taken aback, fighting back tears.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I love you too, Jethro.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Don't call me that.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: I think I will.

In ""Game On"", just before Bartlet goes on stage for the debate, Abbey is affectionate towards him, and also cuts his tie off for luck:

&gt;ABBEY: We'll do mushy later. So, for now, I just got to say I love you so much that my head's going to fly off. But, more importantly, game on, boyfriend! Let's go!  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Okay.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: By the way, I feel bad. I don't think I've done enough to help you prepare for this debate.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Why are you telling me this now?  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet turns around to look back, when Abbey pulls out a pair of scissors and cuts off his tie.  
&gt;  
&gt;ABBEY: Just 'cause.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bartlet looks down at his tie, then up at Abbey who has a sly grin on her face.  
&gt;  
&gt;BARTLET: Oh, my God. You're insane. Are you...? You're insane! Charlie!

Or ""Process Stories"", in which she and Bartlet are being all playful with one another on election night after he's won re-election.

I could go on, but you get the idea.  She's just a great combination of a woman with her own life, work, ambitions, etc, a good mother, and a loving wife who can tear her husband a new one when necessary and show great affection in equal measure.  She's a complex character, and those are usually the best.

I will add the caveat that I don't love the season 5 storyline where she temporarily leaves Jed any more than the rest of you, but I can easily overlook it, because she is almost uniformly a great character before and after that.

For all the criticism Sorkin gets for not writing women well, he created, imo, two of the best female television characters of the last twenty years in Abbey and the next character on the list.

In earlier episodes, he's wearing the Defense Distinguished Service Medal. This medal is third in order of precedence only to the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Navy Cross. For some reason, the ribbon representing the medal doesn't appear in his rack of decorations in later episodes. I'm not sure of the exact episode in which the change appears, but he's at least wearing the ribbon until S01E22 (What Kind Of Day Has It Been). I know this might seem nitpicky to a lot of TWW fans, but it's an issue that's annoyed me since I discovered it.

Obviously I can't link it, otherwise I wouldn't need to ask, but one example scene is the final part of S2E4, In This White House.

669,"The West Wing is the greatest TV show ever made. There I said it. I don't care how fanboy-ish it sounds, I truly believe this. There is simply no other show which combines the same elements of:

- intelligent thought provoking topics

- a ""grand"" and meaningful foundation

- world building

- strong character development with talented actors

- interesting storylines that make you want to follow them to see where it goes

- humor

- relevance (I'm rewatching season 1 where Bartlett decides whether or not to bomb Syria... hmm... sound familiar?)

like this series does. The West Wing does *all* of the above perfectly. There's just no show like it. Most other political shows seem like cheap knockoffs in comparison (ie. Veep, Madame Secretary, etc) and I had high hopes for House of Cards but even that fell short after season 2. Outside of the political realm, the next up would maybe be Battlestar Galactica but even that doesn't really make the cut.

God, this show was such a gem. Thank you Aaron Sorkin."

When Bartlet is talking in New Hampshire, he is talking in front of a ""Don't Tread On Me"" flag in the hall. It had a long snake on it,

And Sam has a ""Don't Tread On Me"" flag in his office during ""Ellie"" I think (when he is talking to Toby about Seth Gillette).

Given what I think these flags mean, and the speech that Mr Sorkin wrote for Isaac in ""The Six Southern Gentlemen of Tennessee"" (Sports Night) I was wondering if they appeared anywhere else, if he had had a change of heart or if these flags meant something else?

x----x

EDIT : Over night is has been pointed out by two comments that the flags apparently do not mean what they think I mean. My knowledge in this area is (I admit) somewhat sketchy, and I have only ever seen them linked to the Confederate flag - hence my confusion.

Apologies - then - for the suggestion in this, and the confusion in general about why Mr Sorkin had Bartlet speaking in front of one of them (in New Hampshire - which did not strike me as a bastion of The Confederate Army) and why Sam would hang one in his office.

As I said - I was just curious, and if we can't learn and ask questions, what else is this site for?"

728,"20 Hours in America - is Josh getting a bad rap? During my rewatch (and subsequent listen to the West Wing Weekly take on it) the consensus seems to be that Donna is completely right in going off on Toby and Josh for their behavior during their ""planes, trains and automobiles"" odyssey.

*""I am not kidding. I have such an impulse to knock your heads together. I can't remember the last time I heard you two talk about anything other than how a campaign was playing in Washington. Cathy needed to take a second job so her dad could be covered by her insurance. She tried to tell you how bad things were for family farmers. You told her we already lost Indiana. You made fun of the fair but you didn't see they have livestock exhibitions and give prizes for the biggest tomato and the best heirloom apple. They're proud of what they grow. Eight modes of transportation, the kindness of six strangers, random conversations with twelve more, and nobody brought up Bartlet versus Ritchie but you. I'm writing letters, on your behalf to the parents of the kids who were killed today. Can I have the table, please?""*

To unpack this, in the opening scene in part 1, Josh seems to be listening to Cathy, while Toby is losing it about President Bartlet's delivery of the speech.  He solicits advice, and is trying to give examples of their struggles.  It's \*Toby\* that says that they were going to lose the state.  Josh didn't hear the bit about Cathy taking a second job for the insurance, because he was in the back of the truck with Cap and Toby.  Yes, he mentioned being briefed about the fair because he was anxious being out of touch, but it wasn't especially dismissive (for Josh, anyway).  And we saw - twice, although Donna only witnessed it once - people say that ""Didn't vote for \[Bartlet\] last time, don't plan on voting for him this time"", and Tyler's friends were also anti-Bartlet, so it wasn't just them talking about the election.  

In the meantime, Josh actually thanks Cathy and Cap, and Tyler.  His point in the running argument with Toby is trying to pay attention to the issues that matter to the voters and not making it about being the smartest kid in the class.  To win, not to beat down Ritchie.  

Yes, Josh does Josh-like things.  He puts his foot squarely in his mouth talking about Cathy to Cap.  He gets pretty racist when he talks about ""Mohammed al Mohammed al Mohammend bin Bizir"".  And apparently he's the reason they had to walk three blocks in the rain (although he did give Donna his coat).  And maybe this was Donna blowing off steam they way Josh and Toby had been all day, but she looks directly at Josh when it was Toby who was the source of most of their frustrations.

Then again, it led to the Matt Kelly scene, which was great and led to a great bit in ""College Kids"""

754,"Dropped storylines. I'm doing my first rewatch of the West Wing after previously watching the whole show about ten years ago. Right now, I'm at the end of season 3. 

Everyone knows that Sorkin has a habit of dropping characters out of the blue. During this rewatch, I'm noticing his habit of dropping major storylines too. Or at least wrapping them up *way* too quickly. Allow me to give some examples. 

* The President's MS. The last five episodes of season two focus on the huge fallout it will cause when the world finds out. It ramps you up to expect an enormous fight that lasts a season. But within ten episodes, Bartlet has accepted the censure and any suggestion of repercussions basically end. The story is dropped, and the focus shifts completely to re-election. 

* Leo's addiction. Once again, they make a huge deal about how much of a fight Leo has on his hands. Then they cut a quick deal and the story is dropped. 

* The aftermath of the shooting is time-lapsed in one episode (midterms). I get why this did this from a story point of view, as you can't have Josh recovering for half a season. But it's one of the biggest events in the Bartlet administration, and it's pretty much skipped through. 

Other notable examples include the breakup of Leo's marriage, Sam's relationship with Laurie being exposed, and Josh's PTSD. 

Basically, I'm asking if anyone else has noticed Sorkin's habit of spending more time on the build-up than he does on the event itself? I'm not criticizing the show, by the way. It's just something I never noticed during my first run-through, and I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same way.

When Will comes to see Toby before he officially works at the white house and they‚Äôre discussing the second innagural. They compare 500 word-essays or whatever and Toby has will stop reading his because Will‚Äôs is much better. Toby discusses the slump he‚Äôs been in and how he had hoped to be one of the all time great speech writers. It‚Äôs probably the best look into Toby that we ever get. To top it all off, will gives toby the letter from sam that says ‚Äúhe‚Äôs one of us.‚Äù The message is so simple but it almost made me cry because it‚Äôs somehow weirdly the best part of sam and toby‚Äôs friendship, how despite all their bickering, they‚Äôre the only two who truly understand each other, and now will is one of them. Then comes will‚Äôs greatest moment where he leaves to go on vacation, then turns right around and asks, ‚Äúunless you want to start right now?‚Äù and toby‚Äôs like ‚Äúyeah.‚Äù The scene is perfection from start to finish and i‚Äôm obsessed with it. I had to rewind it as soon as it was over. Sorry for the rambling description, go back and watch it! "

762,"Assistants I'm doing a rewatch of the series and what's really standing out to me this time is how awesome the assistants are. They have fantastic moments of humor, like the muffins in the commissary. They also care so very much about the staffers. Obviously the main example is Donna and Josh, but there are tons of little moments too, like Mrs. Landingham running out of the room when the news announces the Roslyn shooting. I just got to Enemies Foreign and Domestic, and the cold open is so great with Carol reading the news report on the Saudi Arabian girls who died in the fire. She knows CJ and knows how CJ will react so she brings her the report immediately and stands there completely focused on CJ despite Toby and Sam bantering. It's such a great moment with Carol focused on CJ. I love these characters. "
763,"A small mistake i noticed in S01E04 - Five votes down Started my 1st rerun yesterday !

E04, when the president finishes his speech and steps into his motorcade / car , the motorcade doesnt start immediately but instead waits for his staff (leo, josh, cj) to get into their cars as well, and the staff also happens to be seated in the car in front of the president.

Not sure if :

1.The president's motorcade will wait after the president has stepped inside the car. It's a crowded place they will prefer to get moving immediately.

2.The president will wait for his staff while they chat outside with the public.

Maybe im nitpicking too much ?"

768,"‚ÄúAnd It‚Äôs Sure To Their Credit‚Äù (s2e5) - Tribbey and the Dead Flowers EDIT - obviously I meant ‚Äúsurely‚Äù up there...

I was looking at an old thread on the scene when Sam fires the two a-holes, and there‚Äôs always been a question in my mind about it. The way Tribbey jumps in with his ‚ÄúOh yes. He can. Now leave here and don‚Äôt ever come back.‚Äù It seemed so ... strange and out of character for him. His tone of voice was so sarcastic (as it always was). And his most recent interaction with Ainsley was bad - he didn‚Äôt have any reason to come around to respecting her like the other staffers did. In fact, she called him out. 

Don‚Äôt hate on me for this - I know it doesn‚Äôt make total sense - But ever since the first time I saw the episode (when it aired), I‚Äôve been under the impression that TRIBBEY left the dead flowers (not the two guys), and his ‚Äúleave and never come back‚Äù was a cover. As Sam pointed out - no one signed the ‚ÄúBitch‚Äù note. But also - Sam never actually tells them the reason he‚Äôs firing them, so they never actually confront him about it, confirm it, or deny it. And Tribbey supposedly has no idea what‚Äôs going on - ALL HE KNOWS (unless he knows more, already....) is that Sam is firing them, yet he abruptly jumps in to back him up without hearing anything about the dead flowers.

To me, watching it initially, it seemed so obvious that that was what was happening - That Tribbey left the flowers and found a perfect opportunity to get away with it, because he‚Äôs slimy and only cares about drinks with little umbrellas in them (‚ÄúSHISH KABOB!‚Äù) It doesn‚Äôt seem like ANYONE else saw it that way, though...?"

771,"Is Cliff Calley a good guy? I've been trying to listen to the West Wing Weekly episodes as close to concurrent as I can (watching episodes at night, listening to the episodes at work the next day) and I found Josh Malina's take in the episode for [H. Con-172](http://thewestwingweekly.com/episodes/310) , on Cliff ""helping"" Leo, to be interesting.  Cliff talks about waiting in the ""tall weeds"" for Gibson if he went after Leo in the hearing., but Malina suggests this is a way to save a bargaining chip for later, and that Cliff isn't a good guy at all.

My original take was more like Hrishi's in the episode, that Cliff is a good guy and is trying to make this go away.  But now I wonder if the truth is in the middle.  Going after Leo might have scored a few immediate political points, but would also make, as Cliff said, ""good people hate"" the Republicans.  If the end goal was always to censure the President, then it makes sense that Calley would try to use the threat of Leo's exposure to facilitate that end.   Especially if they knew what Ainsley found out, that the Administration was full of good, righteous people, and specifically what Cliff may have known from reading Donna's diary that no one actually knew.  Calley may have understood prolonged hearings would damage the Republicans even as it did in real life with the Clinton impeachment hearings.

This darker take might be the only way Joe Quincy is able to say what he did about Josh's PTSD connection to music - that it had been in Donna's diary and Calley let it drop at some point.  

I'm still inclined to think Cliff isn't a really bad guy, not nearly the person Josh Malina paints him to be, but I can see him being a bit more calculating that I originally thought.  I do think he had genuine affection for Donna, tho'.

775,"Finished first watch Just finished the season finale yesterday (well technically today at like 3am) and after I finished it, I just felt kinda empty. But now that I‚Äôve had time to process it, I am feeling all of the emotions: happy, sad, overwhelmed. It was so bittersweet. 

I could spend a while talking about the finale, but I‚Äôll just talk about my two favorite parts: Donna looking around her new office as Chief of Staff, and CJ leaving the White House. Those were both really amazing moments for me. Watching Donna grow as a person and work her way up to higher positions was one of my favorite storylines, and the look on CJs face when she told the man she didn‚Äôt work at the White House and walked away was satisfying. CJ was the first character that I liked and the only character that I‚Äôve consistently liked through all 7 seasons. I‚Äôm so glad she ended up happy doing what she wanted to do. Oh, and Bartlet giving Charlie the constitution. That made me actually cry. 

With that being said, I wish the original group all had one last goodbye together in the Oval Office or something. Might‚Äôve been cheesy, but I still would‚Äôve wanted it. 

Starting this show, I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. You hear a show is critically acclaimed and think, ‚Äúok, this show has got a lot of praise from people. I‚Äôll probably like it.‚Äù  This critically acclaimed show puts other critically acclaimed shows to shame. (Seriously, some shows should not be considered critically acclaimed.) I know a lot of people love this show because it gives them hope or it‚Äôs an escape from reality, and while that was true for me as well, what really got me hooked right away was the dialogue and acting. The dialogue is something else, like nothing I‚Äôve seen in any other show. The acting was superb. I figured Martin Sheen and Allison Janney would be great since I‚Äôd seen their work before, but since I had never heard of anyone else I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect of them. They didn‚Äôt disappoint either, especially Richard Schiff.  

While Sorkin‚Äôs era of this show was superior, I was so glad, and pleasantly surprised, that I still enjoyed s5-7 enough to keep watching.  I was scared I wouldn‚Äôt like it because of all the horrible reviews about s5 (unpopular opinion: it wasn‚Äôt that bad.)

This is a show I knew I would rewatch many times before I even finished it. I wanna rewatch it now, I‚Äôm already going through withdrawals, but I have some questions: should take a break before I rewatch it, or watch another Sorkin show? Also should I listen to west wing weekly? I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews. 

(Edit: the only other show I would put on this level is FX‚Äôs ‚Äúthe Americans‚Äù. Both shows are different, but very extraordinary.)

776,When my wife wakes up at midnight and discovers me watching The West Wing and eating nachos...

The hair isn‚Äôt puffy, and it stays that way through the most of season 6, then reverts to the hair he has the rest of the seasons. It‚Äôs definitely shorter on the sides in the Supremes, and season 6 the back is shorter too.

I‚Äôve though that maybe it was a commentary on having more time devoted to personal upkeep after leaving the White House, but it‚Äôs shorter before he leaves...and I know I‚Äôm overthinking.

I was confused the first time I saw this, but assumed it would be addressed later, and as far as I've seen, it hasn't. The only thing I could think of is potential political backlash if people found out, but that concern doesn'f seem to fit the tone of the Bartlet administration. 

Edit: thanks for all the great answers! This part makes a lot more sense to me now. "
784,My friends and I went through a fair bit in our lives in 2018. Decided to put together a late Christmas present for us all. 
785,"My idea for a 'West Wing' revival First off, I don't think it should be called the West Wing. We've seen the inside of a fictionalized White House for seven seasons, and it's unlikely (unless they want to take the perspective of a conservative staff) that there would be so many consecutive or near-consecutive terms of Democrats in the White House.    The new show should be called ""The Beltway.""

Second, while I would love for the old cast to have a role to play, the show cannot focus on them. At least not all of them.  A strong new cast of diverse actors/actresses need to be the center of the show.

As a reflection on our current times, the president occupying the White House is a Trump-like figure... maybe not to the same degree of incompetence and corruption (personal opinion), but in terms of a fascination with social media and waging a war on ""fake news.""

Modeling our present circumstances, Democrats have just gained the majority in the House and have voted Congresswoman CJ Craig to be the Speaker of the House. She ran for congress shortly after the flash-forward from the end of the series after the opening of Bartlet's presidential library reminded her of the impact policy-makers can have versus that of the private sector.   Donna Lyman is the head of the DNC and is struggling to maintain peace between establishment and populist factions within the party.   Charlie Young is a rising star in politics and is a freshman member of the House. He represents a more liberal side of the party and tends to clash occasionally with CJ over her more moderate approach/agenda.  Ainsley Hays is the current president's chief of staff - trying everything in her power to keep some order in the West Wing.   Sam Seaborn and Josh Lyman run a major DC consulting firm.  Their firm is contracted to run a team that will coordinate communication and strategy between the party institutions (DNC/DCCC/House/Senate) - the members of which will make up the new cast of the show.

One of many problems with this concept is that you can't  possibly match the stakes surrounding events that take place in the White House.  Several compelling episodes of the West Wing involved major national security events that directly involved the president.  Of course, nothing stops the show from eventually transitioning into a CJ Craig White House with several former associates brought in to run her staff.

Thoughts?

Securing peace and sustaining hope In this winter of anxiety in fear ...

More than anytime in recent history Americas destiny is not of our own choosing.  We did not seek nor did we provoke an assault on our freedom on our way of life.  We did not expect nor did we invite a confrontation with evil.  Yet the true measure of a people‚Äôs strength is how they rise to master that moment when it does arrive.  44 people were killed a couple of hours ago at Kennison State  University.  3 swimmers from the men‚Äôs team were killed and 2 others are in critical condition when after having heard the explosion from their own practice facility they ran into the fire to help get people out ... RAN INTO THE FIRE...

But that every time we think we‚Äôve measured our capacity to meet a challenge we look up and we‚Äôre reminded that that capacity may well be limit-less.

787,"Why the made up names for some countries but not others? This isn't really a question specific to the west wing--many/most other political dramas do the same, but does anyone have any idea what the reasons would be for making up fictional countries (Qumar, Equatorial Kundu) for some scandals, but using other real countries (Saudi Arabia, Colombia, Iran) in others?

The next scene is of President Bartlet and Abbie staring out of what is presumably Marine One‚Äôs window down at the field Zoey is located in. So the first part of my question is regarding the 25th. If Barlet had ‚ÄúStepped Down‚Äù by invoking the 25th and we don‚Äôt see him re-sign the second letter until a couple scenes later, then how are they on Marine One without President Walken when they rescue Zoey?

790,"S7 E18: Requiem Ok so I actually didn‚Äôt cry in this episode. I‚Äôm shocked. 

I like how they were able to bring back so many guest stars, even if it was only for the funeral scene. Personally, I never really liked Amy, so I thought her scenes were a waste. I would‚Äôve rather had her scenes be replaced with Ainsley. 

I‚Äôm kinda surprised that his funeral wasn‚Äôt held in the Washington National Cathedral like Mrs. Landingham‚Äôs. 

Charlie being shocked that Josh hadn‚Äôt offered Donna a job yet was great, but also not suprising, cause it‚Äôs Josh.  He better offer her a job. 

I loved the scene where Jed told the story about Margaret using a trash can as an umbrella for Leo and accidentally dumping food all over him. I also loved when they all went back up to the residence and shared stories about Leo. It was cute and funny and you could see that they were all deeply touched by him. It was just awkward to see Abbey look so uncomfortable when he was telling the stories. 

It must‚Äôve been really surreal and sad for the cast to have buried John Spencer in real life, and then film an episode where they buried his character. Like I said in my last post, there was probably no need to dig up emotions. 

When I first started the show Leo was one of my favorites. It sad John Spencer couldn‚Äôt be around to finish this great series and see how it ended. 






"
791,"The West Wing Sequel Concept... I was rewatching again and as we have now reached 2019, the 20th anniversary year of The West Wing, I need more episodes... so why not just pitch a sequel. 

Here goes:

We see a young woman in her late teens/early twenties.  Abruptly slamming her laptop shut, barely getting it into her backpack before she runs into a rainy DC. We see a tracking shot of her running out of a building near the national mall.

Cut to a large office building where we find Donna Moss, in a conference room with a large Santos Foundation logo and a table covered in paperwork. A TV is on tuned to MSNBC with her old boss Josh Lyman interviewed.

She unmutes:
 ‚Äú... Nothing is worse than this. I can‚Äôt imagine an administration caught lying about something this crucial...‚Äù

The phone rings. She pauses the tv and hits her speakerphone. 
‚ÄúDonna.‚Äù
‚ÄúPresident Bartlet, is everything okay?‚Äù
‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs fine Donna. Listen, in the next 15 minutes you‚Äôre gonna have a young woman showing up at your door.‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay...‚Äù
‚ÄúHey Donna, you‚Äôre running for Congress?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell Mr. President, I‚Äôm not sure I...‚Äù
‚ÄúYou should, and you should be sure about it!‚Äù
‚ÄúWell thank your sir. I‚Äôm definitely considering my options.‚Äù
‚ÄúGood. Good.‚Äù
‚ÄúUm... Mr. President....This young woman?‚Äù
‚ÄúDonna, she‚Äôs something special. I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on her since... I guess, since she was born.‚Äù

A ruckus is heard at the front of the office. An employee approaches and tries to explain before Donna cuts her off.

‚ÄúLet her in.‚Äù
A few seconds later see the young woman from before, now soaking wet:
‚ÄúDonna, say hello to Cory Tolliver.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you Mr. President. Hello Ms. Moss.‚Äù
‚ÄúDonna, do yourself a favor and hire her.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, Mr. President.‚Äù
The call disconnects as the two women stare at each other, trying to figure out what just happened.‚Äù

A few seconds pass, when Donna realizes.

‚ÄúMs. Tolliver, let‚Äôs take a walk.‚Äù

We flash forward to a walk and talk a couple of years later. Cory is now an assistant to Congresswoman Moss... we eventually weave story lines with original cast members and where they ended up in politics after the end of the original run and we see new story lines about current and past political events including Cory‚Äôs father Morris Tolliver‚Äôs death and the way she was raised (and mentored by the Bartlet family) and we learn her political motivations. 

This is Donna and Cory‚Äôs story now. How they can make it to The West Wing, and what happens once they make it there. "

793,Josh and Therapists named Stanley So I apologize if this has been posted before... but I feel like such a ditz that on my 18th rewatch of the 1st season I realized that the therapist Josh sees in the ‚ÄúCrackpots and these Women‚Äù is named Stanley - which obviously is the same first name as the ATVA therapist that later treats Josh and President Bartlett - Stanley Keyworth. Odd they couldn‚Äôt think of a new first name for a therapist... with the exception of the fake therapist Dr. Jenna Jacobs (definitely one of my top 50 favorite scenes)
794,Why was Leo fired for disagreeing with the Israel-Palestine negotiations? It seems like a bit of an overreaction. Is this literally the first time the two have disagreed on something? Isn‚Äôt the point of advisors to provide multiple points of view on a subject so that the President can pick whichever one they agree with the most? 
795,"S7 E17 Election Day Pt II So I was right. I did cry like a baby.

They had just lost one of their coworkers/friends in real life!)

It‚Äôs assumed Santos has an illegitimate child but it turns out to be his brother‚Äôs child, and Santos stepped up and decided to pay the child support for him. At the end of the episode when Vinick gives Santos back his briefcase, he tells Santos that this information will get out and that the public deserves to know the truth. Which begs my question: How much personal information should a presidential candidate share to the public? Do they have obligation to tell the public every detail of their personal life? Personally, I don‚Äôt think Santos should tell, not only because it would cause a scandal and make him look bad, but because it‚Äôs really none of the public‚Äôs business, and, unlike Bartlet‚Äôs MS, wouldn‚Äôt directly affect his ability to do his job.

It's hard to imagine how the show would have progressed without any of the key characters.  It's hard to think Bartlet even gets elected without Leo, Josh, Toby, Sam and C.J. on his side.  But some other questions are, I think, more nebulous.  What if Jed Bartlet had disclosed his M.S. while Governor?  Could he have gotten elected?  If elected, how does that play out, without that derailing their agenda?  (a weird result - Donna actually has a long term relationship with Cliff Calley, since the investigation was the only thing derailing it).   What if Josh doesn't get shot in ItSoTG?   Does have him at the office all summer help them in the midterms?  

What sort of ""what if?"" possibilities intrigue you?"

One thing led to another and I started looking at WH floor plan (I don‚Äôt know what train of thought led me there). I realized that the real one is quite off from the set one (or the other way around). 

For example between the Oval Office and Chief of Staff‚Äôs office there are other offices. 
I thought maybe it has changed since the show aired, but then I remembered in the Clinton Affair (recent documentary) Monica Lewinsky mentions that there was a door that led to pres‚Äô private study. While in the show it‚Äôs Leo‚Äôs office. 

I think House of Cards and Madam Secretary have their set closer to reality.

824,"I'm having the weirdest experience post another rewatch. I've had lots of hospital and home bed time recently so I got a VPN that gets me American Netflix and rewatched TWW for the Million-Gajillion^th time.   

I finished it really quickly (again) and felt that hollowness that you get once you finish so I decided to watch another presidential type show to keep me (kind of) in the white house zone.    

For some reason I decided to watch Designated survivor. Although it's kind of....a bit shit... I think the story idea of it is fantastic, I only wish sorkin wrote the plot.    

One thing that annoys me is the utter disregard the show has for proper white house procedure and unrealistic presidential priorities (like not even think about naming a VP immedi after the explosion), or the secret service allowing the president to slip away ""from the office"" with only one secret service agent to watch his estranged son play the violin etc.....

But what annoys me the most, is that it stole some of sorkins lines and ideas. They were poorly executed but still... I don't think it's very fair...or maybe it is, after all good writers borrow from other writers, great writers steal from them outright.    

I have to be truthful with what I'm saying so although the show winds me up, I can't stop watching it for the cheesey conspiracy involved.   

It's like the west wing is some relatively unknown jazz band from the 50s who pioneered many forms of jazz that evolved into other, more modern genres and Designated survivor is a cheesey pop Club tune that has no depth or substance but you can't help agreeing is catchy, I'm really annoyed with myself but also enjoying, hence the weird experience.   

I guess what I'm asking, in the interest of open debate, is what screen adaptations of American politics have you seen that have wound you up, and why? "

I must have blocked the bit out where both Josh and Will want to use Baker's wife's depression against him, because I do not remember it happening at all. It made me like Santos more that he forbade Josh from using it, and Donna more because she tried to get Will not to do it, but I think it ranks up there as one of the worst things anyone on the show has ever done. 

Especially coming from Josh, who was outraged that Leo's drug and alcohol abuse came out in public, and Leo clearly had far more power than a potential First Lady would. Do they mention this instance again at some point or are we just stuck knowing that Josh and Will are morally repugnant?"

2. Oregon is said to have been been decided by around a couple of thousand votes, yet Nevada was the state that got more attention, even though there was a 30,000 vote margin (which isn't super close in Nevada terms). Is this something to do with Oregon's all-mail balloting system?

838,The West Wing and Star Trek the Next Generation: Parallels? 
839,"a moveable feast - the loves of Sam Seaborn Rob Lowe was supposed to be the focus of *The West Wing.*  He's the first of the staff we meet in the pilot.  In the spirit of the relationship threads for Josh and C.J., I'd like to propose a discussion of his love life.  He was engaged when he joins the Bartlet Team, and he's engaged when he joins the Santos Administration, but I think this is really a two horse race with two women he doesn't (seem to) end up with.

5. Lisa Sherborne - writer for Vanity Fair, the ex-fianc√©e.  You can see flashes of what might have been there during ""100,000 Airplanes"", but Sam says that she didn't like him very much.

4. Unnamed Fianc√©e - Nothing really to go on.  We know she's a lawyer, we know she seems to be OK with him taking the Deputy CoS job.  So apparently they talk, which would rank her ahead of Lisa.

3. Laurie - I don't care for the Laurie subplot, but the writers did show that two cared for one another.  It might be interesting if she somehow ended up being the unnamed fianc√©e, but that's unlikely.  Her former profession would be an albatross around the neck of both Sam and the administration.

2. Mallory O'Brien - This was hard.  I love Sam &amp; Mallory.  Allison Smith was great and had great chemistry with Rob Lowe.  Ultimately, I think it was doomed.  She never seemed to get the life of devotion required, even when the President and Leo tried to explain it to her.  She would have left Sam just like her mother left Leo.  But it would've been fun for a while.

1. Ainsley Hayes - It's a shame Emily Procter got the *CSI:Miami* gig.  She and Lowe were dynamite together, and Ainsley brought a different dynamic to the show, and might have been a great venue to explore conservative viewpoints.  It would have been interesting in the mythical season 8 how they would've dealt with her and Sam, because the sparks would keep flying. 

special mention - Josh Lyman.  I don't personally see Sam or Josh as gay or bi, but I've seen the theory online, and I don't think people are pulling it out of thin air.  Josh is singularly unimpressed - both times - to hear his supposed best friend is engaged.  Sam isn't asking him to be his best man (from what we see, anyway)  There are a couple times during my season 2 rewatch where Sam seems a little jealous of Joey Lucas, but I could be letting online chatter color my perception.

But weirdly, it was in this role that he left a lasting impression on me, because he refused to start World War III without knowing why. Without knowing if it was real, why they were doing it, why they were killing millions of people.

WarGames is a truly phenomenal movie for so many reasons and this is definitely one of them.

Curious what others think. I kind of get it: he's becoming more invested in the idea of a legacy, and that's nothing to scoff at, but that whole arc seems odd to me in many ways.

Upset with our country's current state of affairs, powers within the Democratic party meet to decide how to move forward. This way much of the cast is reunited. However, they disagree on who to run in the next elections. Factions are created and we watch as they pit candidates against each other to be the Democratic nominee. The season will also show the republican White House as it scrambles to prepare for the upcoming fight. My vote is Seaborn for presidency.

3.   Ben Dryer - Well, Carol liked him, so he's got that going to him, I guess.

2.   Toby Ziegler - Unconsummated, but the flirtation and spark between Richard Schiff and Allison Janney is incredible.  Easy to see some sort of thing having happened in the past between them.

1. Danny Concannon - is there any other option?  Steadfast, loyal, intelligent, diligent and above all honest, Danny is almost too perfect.  He makes his intentions clear from the start , he banters well with her, he shows that he can juggle his feelings for her and still do Pulitzer quality investigative work.

2. Donna Moss - Obviously an easy favorite, but because she was his protege and he a mentor, it seemed a little awkward.  Plus, I always felt he thought he was better than her and couldn't shake it.    They always seemed like high school sweethearts but with Josh, he was always focused in his career.  They probably could have had a couple of good years, Josh divorces her because he is too focused on work.
3. Amy Gardner - she is fun and devious at the same time.  It is off and on for several years.  Maybe they get married and have kids.  She eventually divorces him in some public scandal but it is actually a conspiracy started by Amy and Josh has to rebuild up his career.

I don't knows, I always saw these connections in this way with Joey as the front-runner.

Edit: How about this for a thought experiment.  Josh marries Amy, they end up in a messy divorce and scandal.   He rebounds back to Donna.  Donna feels neglected, eventually divorces Josh.

896,"What are some of your completely random favorite moments? What are some moments or conversations that are random and aren't really tied to the main stories.  Here are mine.

\- In season 4, I loved when CJ laughs out loud when that foreign woman said her name.

\- I love when Leo's secretary is always gossiping and then tells Leo.  She has the funniest face of shock

\- Loved the back and forth between Will and Toby

\- Loved the back and forth between Josh and Santos

\- Charlie and Barlett had some good back and forth conversations

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes they are so random but some moments are hilarious.  I wonder if the writers added them all in or were they just the actors doing spur of the moment stuff.

898,"Watch Through Question‚ÄîBingo Bob Finished a watch through of Season 5 and I‚Äôve been thinking about President Bartlet nominating Russell for VP. The first choice was Sec. Berryhill until the Speaker made it clear that Congress wouldn‚Äôt confirm him. It always seemed to me that Russell was a strange choice because no one really wanted him, including the President. It was such a passive choice, almost as if the administration gave up. This was an important appointment given the President‚Äôs health concern and it essentially elevated a no name congressman to the national stage. I seem to remember that after President Bartlet told Leo that Russell would be the nominee, he was visibly frustrated and didn‚Äôt even bother telling the staff. He just went off to bed.

Anyone else think this was out of character for the President, Leo, Toby, Josh, etc.? Seems like they bent over backwards to please the Republicans for something as important as the VP.

Edit: I know that Russell‚Äôs name was on the list of ‚Äúsuggested nominees‚Äù. I just can‚Äôt believe they actually chose a name on the Speaker‚Äôs list. "

901,"Josh as Chief of Staff I just finished my second watch through of TWW, and I'm finding it hard to see Josh succeeding as Chief of Staff.  

I prefer the headcanon that Leo gave C.J.'s name to President Bartlet over Josh's because he needed Josh out on the campaign trail finding a successor, but I feel the skill set we're presented for Josh doesn't seem to translate to the next level.  He's got the knowledge of domestic issues, certainly, and he's generally absorbed the right procedure for things, but he's never been in the Situation Room and he thinks of Italy as the ""one that looks like a boot"".  

What's worse, we never see Josh being good with people, particularly from a leadership standpoint.  His complete flub of the rally &amp; thank the troops moment in ""Election Day"" would concern me greatly.  There's no sense that any of his staff will have anything close to the loyalty that Leo enjoyed.  He has Sam, and then has has people like Amy &amp; Lou who he's had to fight more than he's worked with.

I keep coming back to the advice Bartlet gave Secretary Tribbey during the State of the Union, when he was ""the guy"" - that your Chief of Staff should be your best friend, and that isn't Josh for Matt Santos.  They go head to head on most issues, and with Kazakhstan possibly derailing the first 100 days, I can only see that tension increasing.

I also feel the loss of Leo was never fully explored for Josh.  Going back to Donna's comments to Amy in ""Commencement"", about his biggest fear being losing people he loves and it being his fault, this is another huge hit to his mental health.  His deterioration during ""Transition"" could even been looked at as a PTSD relapse, with his explosion at Otto somewhat equivalent to putting his hand through the glass.  (Which makes me wonder about Donna and her lying to Santos - she had to know that Josh had never been this bad, right?  Was she downplaying his status so Santos wouldn't think he couldn't do the job or did she literally not see how bad he was - was it that she didn't want to see it?)  

TL;DR - Josh wasn't an ideal CoS candidate at his best, and circumstances were stack against him succeeding."

910,"The West Wing and the Current Administration I‚Äôm watching the West Wing for the first time (and I‚Äôm HOOKED, to the point where someone seriously needs to take my Netflix account away from me. Also Richard Schiff now owns my soul)

I keep finding myself comparing characters to the current Trump administration, wondering if the culture in the White House is still the same. I also feel nostalgic ? As if something pure has been lost.

A lot of the episodes are super idealistic so far, but it surprisingly doesn‚Äôt bother me.

Ainsley in particular is interesting, because at first I thought she‚Äôd be like Kelly Anne Conway, but I like the direction the show is taking with her. They both initially give off the same vibe / ability to spin. 

Anyhow,,, I don‚Äôt know a ton about US politics but I feel like I‚Äôm learning a lot through the show and also feel like I‚Äôm constantly comparing how I think the current Administration would handle events that happen in the show.

I‚Äôm not sure where I‚Äôm going with this, as it‚Äôs super late and I have put off,,, a ton of my homework to read 2010 AV Club reviews for the episodes I binged :P 

Edit: I guess I‚Äôm wondering, if you watch the show now, do you feel the same way? Has your opinion of the show changed based on who was president at the time you watched it? Does rewatching it make you aware of things you weren‚Äôt before?"
911,Why Glenn Close wasn't in the last episode as Chief Justice? Was her nomination rejected by the Congress? 
912,"Currently rewatching the series and I wonder how the Bartlett team would react to a Trump presidency... Imagine if Trump was elected right after Bartlett.

927,"Couple of random questions after watching again I watched the show again and these questions are getting to me.  They are kind of random and focus on last seasons.

\- In the later seasons, I was really confused between the role of Hoynes and Russell (they looked so much alike).  Anyway, what did Will do during that time.  Did  he work for the President, both Vice Presidents.  Sometimes at the same time?   How was he able to get so much access with the President's staff when he was working for the Vice President?

\- Harper was  Deputy National Security Advisor ?, she seemed to have a lot of influence when in the situation room.  Is this normal in real life?    Also, she seemed kind of young  to be a commander and Deputy NSA advisor, could that happen?

\- What is the role of White House Counsel?  Especially towards the end with the leak.  I guess to protect the White House.  But what if something in the White House violates the law, do they have to keep silent or does the counsel have to report the illegality?     There is one scene with a WH leaker, does the leaker have to cooperate with White House counsel at all?

\- What happened to Zoe after she was captured.  There were a lot of holes there.  They could have done several episodes just going over the timeline of the capture and afterwards.

Random thoughts on the show, there were good episodes and better episodes.   Josh was amazing and hilarious in every episode, I can't think of a bad Josh scene.  He saved season 6 and 7.    Bartlett wasn't hilarious but loved when he was on the soap box.    For the me the best scenes were the serious ones with the situation room.    They could have done a whole spin-off show just on that."

932,This thread went full-on West Wing. 
933,"Discussion: Season 7, episode 7 - ""The Debate"" I watched today the debate episode and have mixed opinions about it. So I will try to list some points and them we discuss:

* With the exception of seconds of background before they entered in the stage the entire episode was shot as a real televised debate. Seems strange to me this choice of Alex Graves because on all the seasons we see the opposite: a lot of background and very little of the debates, speeches and interviews aired. We never got to watch Zoey entire interview after being kidnapped or the President and the First Lady disclosing the MS in the interview.

* The writing of Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr. in this episode is inconstant. I love the dialogues, researched arguments  defended well, a lot of quips and insights. But the whole premise fails to me, I couldn't believe that the moderator would be so willing to forget the rules and also do no understand the reason Vinick would do something so boldy without consulting Sheila.

* Matt interrupts a lot Vinick. And the moderator only accepted the changes in the debate if he could control both candidates. I thought the moderator was too weak.

* Jimmy Smits was great, but Alan Alda absolutely stoled this episode. He was incredible, his character was very real and I really enjoyed his perfomance.

What do you think about this episode? I would love to hear more opinions.

"
934,Today‚Äôs Snapple fact 
935,"Am I the only one who doesn't like season 3? I'm almost finished with my first run-through of the series (just started season seven today). Seasons 1-2 are my favorites, season 4 is okay, season 5 was boring, and I'm actually enjoying seasons 6-7 (the campaign angle gave the series a breath of fresh air, I thought). But the one season that I really did not like was season 3.

Ignoring the two special episodes (which I do) the season just didn't live up to my expectations. We ended season two with Bartlet pausing before he answered the reelection question, and then season three begins with everything seemingly all over the place. The whole ""did Bartlet lie about his MS plot?"" would have been good if it didn't end as abruptly as it did (I thought the way it ended was such a cop-out, too). New characters Babish and Bruno I just could not stand - Bruno got on my nerves all the time (though part of me thinks that was the point) and there was something about Babish I didn't like. Funnily enough, I actually don't mind them in season 7 (probably because we don't see them as often). And truthfully, I can barely remember any episodes from the season.

Anybody else feel this way about the third season?"

938,"What happened to NiCole Robinson? Margaret was one of my favorite characters on the show: the weirdness, the husky voice, her loyalty. I find it very strange that after being in 106 episodes of  The West Wing she was only credited in Imdb with five other works. Did she gave up acting? Was she a difficult actress to work with? Why after the show she didn't got good work opportunities like the rest of the cast?"
939,Looks like Sam won the California 47th!

941,"John Wells and his crew fundamentally misunderstood The West Wing I've posted here before about how I've really [had trouble with season 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/thewestwing/comments/61wyln/season_5/). Listening to The West Wing Weekly's episode on 'Memorial' helped me get to an epiphany about why. Josh and Hrishi to their credit enjoyed season 5 and were quite even handed with their comments. At one point they mentioned how Season 5 has been lacking 'Deus Ex Machina' resolutions that Aaron Sorkin would use. During that section they also commented that Sorkin's West Wing was a ""fairy tale"" and how John Wells' version was not.

I agree entirely and that, in my opinion, is the problem.

John Wells decided to give us just another TV show where the characters squabble and their ideals are crushed by the burdens of everyday life. Sorkin gave us an idealistic show that showed the absolute best that motivated people could achieve. Yes, it was light-hearted and showed unlikely situations like conflicts between the POTUS and CoS resolving overnight. 

But that's what made it wonderful.

It wasn't the depressing drudgery that politics can sometimes be. Even in loss, Sorkin's White House maintained its composure and plowed ahead while Wells' ruminates in the juices of its disappointment. It's just not the show that hooked me. Yes, the fact that POTUS and Leo are best of friends through thick and thin with no prolonged arguments is unrealistic. But that is what made the show special. It showed us what could be and what we can aspire to. ""A more perfect life"" if you will. It's inspiring.

No surprise then that some of the best moments in season 5 are the ones with the deus ex machinas like the Republican caucus delaying long enough for the President to walk away, scoring him a political win. Or Josh coming up with the genius solution of placing two justices from ideologically opposite ends of the spectrum (who are conveniently already good friends).

Let's be honest, Wells' West Wing is still far superior to 99% of other TV but it misses why people enjoyed the show that came before it.

S1-S4 was Sam saying it"

Anyway, I was walking to work this morning and I chanced past a caf√© that was playing ""Brothers In Arms"" by Dire Straits (of course, I don't need to mention which episode this is in) and it fair gave me chills, even after so many times through.

945,"So we got to Isaac and Ishamael Me again. Newbie. Still in awe of this goddamn show and I need somewhere to put these feelings since no one else I know watches this show and you‚Äôre now my unwilling audience. (Trust me, that will be rectified soon.)

So the season three opener. The first episode after 9/11. I sort of knew something like this was coming, bc of the time period, I just really wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be... this. The conversation Josh, Toby, Sam and CJ have with those high school kids in the mess, is perhaps, one of my favourite scenes of the episode. It‚Äôs not only the topics ‚Äî Sam talking about terrorism‚Äôs failure rate, Josh‚Äôs SAT inspired question for those students, Toby talking about his Dad‚Äôs friend who was praying, CJ discussing the intelligence community ‚Äî but the imagery of these four insanely smart, powerful political figures who literally got a President elected giving this impromptu forum to the next generation? And the juxtaposed with Leo‚Äôs questioning, being brutal and bitter and moderately prejudiced?

I‚Äôve read reviews that say this episode was preachy and pointless and it didn‚Äôt plain work after the S2 finale but ya know what? I think it does. I think putting this in an episode where the characters are all incredibly liberal, and still showing their divergent, complex, confusing beliefs in a form and questioning setting ‚Äî I think that works. I think it sends the message that just because you‚Äôre right on some things, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre right on all things.

Then again I could be wrong ‚Äî I am the newbie around these parts!"
946,"What was President Bartlett's unofficial policy with the press on issues involving his daughters? (Specific Reference) It's been a while since I've watched the West Wing. I seem to remember a scene in which President Bartlett got super pissed off at a member of the Press Corp that was asking personal questions about his daughters/ approached his daughter with questions without asking the administration officially. 

If I recall correctly, Josiah has this journalists ""Press Credentials"" pulled, though I believe it was done through unofficial channels with the network/ newspaper the guy worked for. This, in turn led to the network/ newspaper replacing the previous journalist with one that was much more critical of the Bartlett Administration. 

Am I mixing up shows? What episode was this in? With the whole Acosta thing going on right now, it reminded me of this so I was hoping to go back and find the episode, but I can't find it and I don't have time to watch the entire series again.

979,"The administration's less notable moments Given the events of the last week, I got to thinking about the less than stellar moments of the Bartlet administration. Not the policies, but its little decisions :-

CJ pulled the press credentials of a reporter because she didn't like how that reporter covered a story.

The President pardoned Toby less than a year after he committed a truly appalling national security breach, just because he liked the guy.

&amp;#x200B;

We seem to find this behaviour acceptable from The Bartlet administration, even adorable, and yet in real life we find it appalling. 

But should we?"

981,"Has anybody watched Mary McCormack (Kate Harper) on ""The Kids Are Alright""? I watched the first three episodes of ""The Kids Are Alright"", a new show on ABC, the other day and I really enjoy it. Mary McCormack is very good, though her two characters are nothing alike so don't go in expecting that. She does a great job playing a mom of eight boys in the early 70's. Anybody else watch it?"
982,"Looking for a specific scene about a bipartisan meeting There's a scene that I can't specifically recall but I'm hoping someone can help me find it...

Two politicians are brought into one of the meeting rooms in the West Wing. One is a Republican, the other a Democrat. They quip at each other something like ""You think I'm a bleeding heart liberal who wants to raise taxes"" and the other says something like ""And you think I'm a heartless flag-waving conservative"". Then one says ""but there is one thing we agree on..."" and then they both say the same thing and grin at each other. I have a feeling it was campaign finance reform, but I can't remember exactly.

Does this ring any bells? Any help identifying this scene would be much appreciated. Thanks!"
